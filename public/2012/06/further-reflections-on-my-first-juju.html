<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Since I wrote the notes that appear in my previous post, I&#8217;ve had a chance to reflect further on my experience writing a Juju charm.<br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">The thing is, even though the end result is very cool – I can just deploy this code as a new service whenever I want without having to think about it – the experience wasn&#8217;t great. I wasn&#8217;t having a fun time getting it to work. I think there are a few reasons for this.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">First, I was on my own. I work from home and most days I sit down in my office and plug away at my laptop. I generally like it, but there are times when it&#8217;s not great. Most of the time I&#8217;m doing things I already know how to do: debugging strange production problems; deleting unnecessary Python code; encouraging people to get to the point in meetings and <a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts/J8to9rW8Ef8">despairing over voice communication technologies</a>.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Juju is still a fairly new technology. The <a href="http://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/">published documentation</a> is still a bit raw, the website isn&#8217;t the easiest to navigate and the tools could do a better job at being self-documenting. It&#8217;s demotivating to want to do a thing, not know how to do it and not know how to find out how to do it. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I mentioned that #juju is a much better place when the US is awake: that&#8217;s when the experts are around. T</span><span style="background-color: white;">he Juju shamans know about these problems and are working now to the whole learning experience much better.</span><br /><br />Tangent: I&#8217;d very much encourage you to go to a <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/CharmSchool">Charm School</a> if you get the chance. The Juju guys are super-helpful, fun to be around, and the whole thing is much more pleasant when you&#8217;re with other people and not the only one asking dumb questions. I went to one, but I didn&#8217;t do the <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/CharmSchool#Necessary_Software">preparation</a>, and had a dodgy laptop, so I spent all of my time head-butting network issues rather than actually writing charms. <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/getting-started.html#configuring-a-local-environment">Do the preparation</a>.<br /><br />Second, the core feedback loop wasn&#8217;t that great. I&#8217;m a bit spoiled. Most of the time, I run tests, they run very quickly, I get very nicely formatted results in colour, I fix the small, known number of failures, I run the tests, everything works and I get a visual sweetie from laptop. Automating the deploymment of pre-alpha software is not like that at all.<br /><br />The feedback loop is longish, about 2-5 minutes. By default, you have to sit watching the debug-log to tell when it&#8217;s done or when it hits a fatal error.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">If you accidentally run an interactive command in your install hook, then deployment will stall.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">You don&#8217;t get any notice of success or failure, and certainly nothing that you could integrate into your desktop (e.g. beep when done). Over two minutes is long enough for me to get distracted, but under five minutes is short enough that I won&#8217;t switch to any task that requires concentration. It doesn&#8217;t make for a pleasant day.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Oh, I should mention that I got stuck for a while at the very outset, redeploying the same version of my charm because I forgot to update the revision file and didn&#8217;t realize that I actually wanted to run deploy with the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&#8211;upgrade</span> option.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">When you do get errors, there are likely to be many of them, and they are messily strewn about the debug log in hard to find places, cluttered with useless stuff. This is largely not Juju&#8217;s fault: it&#8217;s the fault of the system tools that you have to call to get things set up. Juju&#8217;s debug-log does give an option to limit output to just &#8220;ERROR&#8221; level message, but that includes noise from things like GPG and Bazaar (which emit to stderr as part of normal behaviour, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/955209">which Juju interprets as ERROR</a>). It also doesn&#8217;t give you enough context to debug the real errors. There are also some <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1015655">formatting glitches</a>, and it doesn&#8217;t have colour.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br />I mentioned these things about the feedback loop to a colleague. He rightly pointed out that I was speaking very much as a programmer, accustomed to bouncing on <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">make check</span>. For a sysadmin, being able to redeploy on a fresh machine from scratch and see all the errors in one place in under five minutes is a huge improvement.<br /><br /><br /><span style="background-color: white;">Third, I have to pass on some of this knowledge to&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;users. Or at least, people who are contributing to my project ought to be able to quickly learn how to fire up the charm. At the moment, there are still a few too many ifs, buts, maybes and perhaps-try-thises that I&#8217;m <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/1054697/">compelled to include</a>. I&#8217;ll probably turn the documentation into a script at some point, as others seem to <a href="https://gist.github.com/2050525">have</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/1406018">done</a>.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s a <i>much </i>longer post than I expected. Sorry. I hope it helps some.</span><br /></div>

@clint-fewbar, thanks for the &#39;ccze&#39; tip. That&#39;s very useful, and not just for juju charming.<br /><br />@Kapil, thanks. I discovered replay and log level filtering pretty early on. The log level filtering was a bit annoying as -l ERROR didn&#39;t give me <i>all</i> the errors, included some non-errors, and didn&#39;t provide enough context for the errors that were included.<br /><br />I&#39;m not really sure what an agent is or how it matters.</div>

thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />just fwiw, juju debug-log has very fine grained options for exactly targeting what your interested in, you can listen in on a particular agent or group of agents,  exclude hook output, capture logs at a particular level, replay logs, etc.</div>

Jono, thanks so much for spending time with juju, its really great to hear some fresh new thoughts (and to have a few old problems reiterated so we remember to address them.)<br /><br />For the feedback loop, I think the &#39;debug-hooks&#39; command is going to save you a lot of problems at least in terms of being able to run your hook over and over until its &quot;right&quot;. The problem is that unlike a test suite, we are changing the system state *on purpose* so iterating means getting back to the same starting state. I do think we need to make better use of LXC&#39;s ability to clone containers in the debug-hooks command, but network complexity becomes an issue, so we&#39;ll have to keep working on this.<br /><br />Also for colorized logs:<br /><br />juju debug-log | ccze -A<br /><br />The ccze tool&#39;s general rules will produce a pretty nicely highlighted log for you. The ERROR issue remains, but I think we&#39;ll solve that soon enough with the patch you submitted. :)</div>
