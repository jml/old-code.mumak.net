I believe in time-based releases. I believe in frequent releases. I believe in a trunk branch that is always ready to be a release candidate. Many Free Software developers share my beliefs. For a long time I haven&#8217;t questioned it. It&#8217;s obviously good to release regularly and often.<br /><blockquote>&#8220;It is hard to argue that bzr isn&#8217;t in a state of flux when a new stable version is available once a month.&#8221; - Jason Earl, Bazaar mailing list.<br /></blockquote>Now I think I have to begin asking questions.<br /><br />Is it possible that time-based releases actually create negative impressions of software? Should regular releasers slow down their cadence? How should compatibility watersheds (format, API, whatever) affect a release cycle? What would Bazaar&#8217;s format reputation be like if they released every six months instead of every month?</div>

@bialix: I think that point releases (especially when security fixes and fixes for major regression are involved) should be released any time if needed.<BR/><BR/>If bzr is to move to a longer release cycle (3 months, say), it can still do montly alpha/beta releases: an alpha on the end of the first month, a beta on the end of the second one (if no release critical bug id found, them is could slip some days), and a rc or two on the week before the final release.</div>

My thoughts are not as specific as other commenters, but essentially: bzr does not provide any way to judge the level of change in its releases: the number is essentially 1.X where X is the number of months since 1.0 (give or take).<BR/><BR/>While Ubuntu also uses a similar strategy, most Free Software people really are accustomed to X.Y where a change in X means big changes including likely major fixes and improvements but also to beware of breakage, and a change in Y means tweaks to what you know, breakage unlikely. (For projects with dependant projects, X.Y.Z is better where a change in Z means no ABI/API break from the previous release, as required.)<BR/><BR/>Of course, one can get this from the release notes, but one doesn&#8217;t read them&#8230;</div>

I think bzr practive to release every 4 weeks is too frequent for the most users/admins. Once at 2 or 3 months is much better.<BR/><BR/>May be only point releases, e.g. 1.13.X should be released once at month.<BR/><BR/>E.g. for version X.Y.Z<BR/><BR/>Z = every month (only bugfixes)<BR/>Y = every 3 months (improvements)<BR/>X = every 9-12 months (big improvements, new formats)</div>

Also, If new formats had a big set of new features (instead of the one-format-per-new-feature-every-now-and-again like it is now), people would be more excited about upgrading. At least brisbane-core is something everybody will be really *really* excited about :)</div>

I have to agree with Eduardo there.  One of the reasons specifically cited by Brett Cannon today when discussing Python-on-hg is the number of changes to release formats in bzr.<BR/><BR/>I think that has way more of an impact on the impression of stability than does the frequency of releases; people just want to know it will always work wherever they happen to need some code, regardless of what version is installed there.<BR/><BR/>I don&#8217;t see any reason to question the basic concept of always being ready to release, but that&#8217;s not the same as releasing all the time.  :-)  Every month is good for a pre-1.0, after that, 3 or 6 months is a better pace to set.  Being ready gives you the ability to do a critical bugfix release at the drop of a hat.</div>

Please keep the monthly releases. It&#8217;s quite nice to have the new features on a packaged format earlier. The developer are forced to keep the project in a &#8220;releasable&#8221; state more often too. <BR/><BR/>But I&#8217;d ask, *please*, don&#8217;t add new default repository formats so often. <BR/>My proposal: do time-based *major* (2.0, 3.0, &#8230;) releases too, every 6 months for example, and add a new default format only to this releases. <BR/><BR/>The new format, accumulating all backward incompatible changes, could be developed on a branch and integrated as a &#8211;development format when its good enough (like it is now), but only released as the default on a major release.<BR/><BR/>This way, distributions can offer always a bzr with the latest (or almost) format, and teams/hosting sites/sysadmins can get prepared to upgrade their repos less often.</div>

Michael Hudson: Oh right! I remember now.<BR/><BR/>Actually, idempotency in the computing sense is only meaningful where there ARE side effects.<BR/><BR/>For a couple of pythonic examples: &#8220;a[b] = c&#8221; where a is a list IS idempotent. But &#8220;a.pop()&#8221; is not.<BR/><BR/>Since the last thing you want from a hash function is to mutate its argument, the only meaningful sense for &#8220;idempotent hash function&#8221; is the mathematical one.<BR/><BR/>And etrepum is confused.</div>

Idempotency (in computing) is not the same as side-effect free, or always returning the same value for the same arguments, but rather than calling it multiple times has the same effect as calling it once.  Bob is perhaps using bigs words where simple ones would do :)<BR/><BR/>Alex is right that this is the same as the mathematical definition if you view the state of the world as implicitly passed to and returned from every function you call.</div>

Oh feh, I had to reread your quote of Bob and then his original post before I got it not being what I thought it was.<BR/><BR/>I do use idempotent in computing in the mathy way, but maybe that is because I&#8217;m a math student.</div>

The mathematics definition of idempotent sort of makes sense in computing if you view a function as taking a state and returning the state of the system after the function is applied.<BR/><BR/>Then the property f(f(x)) = f(x) seems like a desirable one if equality is replaced by some equivalence relation<BR/><BR/>This is still weaker than invariance of f though&#8230;</div>

Oh, a new pet peeve!<BR/><BR/>From now on I&#8217;ll make it a point that &#8220;idempotent&#8221; DOES mean &#8220;f(f(x)) = f(x)&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>I did not realize that people were using it with this other, incorrect meaning.<BR/><BR/>f(x)=f(x) is invariant, or referentially transparent, or side-effect free, whatever. Real idempotence is a useful property to be able to name in computing.<BR/><BR/>Join me and embrace the joy of self-righteousness!</div>

Very, very recently, we changed Launchpad to <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bug/237465">support team +junk branches</a>. So recently, in fact, I don&#8217;t think the change has hit the servers yet. Anyway, after the 2.2.3 release on April 1, you&#8217;ll be able to push up &amp; create branches in lp:~your-team-here/+junk/some-branch.<br /><br />I have to confess I&#8217;m not a huge fan of this feature. Almost all of the time, if you&#8217;ve got some code in a branch and you want others to collaborate on it you should <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/projects/+new-guided">create a new project</a>. That way you can file bugs, do code reviews and get easy branch stacking support.<br /><br />Still, the use case that <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaserjock">Jordan</a> mentions is a good one, and the fix fell out naturally from some of the work we&#8217;ve done for source package branches, so we decided to do it. You see, we actually do get a kick out of making our users happy. Really.<br /><br />I guess the moral of the story, if there is one at all, is to <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+filebug">file bug reports</a>. We don&#8217;t want to build a website with <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/The_Homer_by_Carlos_Bisquertt.jpg">separate bubble domes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F">three horns that all play &#8220;La Cucaracha&#8221;</a> so we aren&#8217;t going to mindlessly say &#8220;yes&#8221; to everything. But we do want to make something that will help you rock the Free Software world even harder, and to do that, we need to know what you want.</div>

You might not know about Firefox smart bookmarks. They let you type something into your URL bar like &#8220;twisted 2345&#8221; and have Firefox load the Twisted bug page for bug #2345. Lifehacker explains <a href="http://lifehacker.com/387944/how-to-make-your-own-smart-bookmarks-in-firefox-3">how to create them</a>.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s one to add for Launchpad branches:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://code.mumak.net/uploaded_images/Screenshot-Properties-for--759585"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 196px;" src="http://code.mumak.net/uploaded_images/Screenshot-Properties-for--759574" alt="" border="0" /></a>Once you&#8217;ve added this, you can type &#8216;lp twisted&#8217; or &#8216;lp python&#8217; into your Firefox location bar and get redirected to the branch page for Firefox. Anything that works as part of an lp: URL will work here.

I&#8217;ve been waiting since November for this.<br /><br />Now, if you submit a branch for review on Launchpad, Launchpad will automatically generate the diff for you. For example, take a look at <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/subunit/filter/+merge/4006">the review page for one of lifeless&#8217;s subunit branches</a>.<br /><br />To take advantage of the feature, go to the page of a branch you want to land (you can use bzr lp-open to do this), then click on &#8220;Propose for merging into another branch&#8221;. Select the branch you want to land it on (normally trunk, which is the default branch), then type some stuff explaining what the patch does. Hit &#8220;Submit&#8221;, wait a minute or so, then refresh. Voila.<br /><br />We hope to tweak the page later so that it&#8217;s obvious that a diff is being generated and so you don&#8217;t have to refresh. Even so, I&#8217;m very pleased that we got this done. Thanks particularly to Aaron for getting this landed.</div>

I asked this self-same question on the Bazaar mailing list the other day. Here&#8217;s the answer:<br /><ul><li>Given that the place you push the branch to (its &#8220;push location&#8221;) might be different from the place that others get the branch from, branch&#8217;s have public locations.</li><li>Any tool that shares your branch with others (e.g. bzr send, a commit notifier or even lp-open) needs to have a public location to share with the world.</li></ul></div>

I&#8217;ve just pushed <a href="http://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/+junk/bzr-difftodo">lp:~jml/+junk/bzr-difftodo</a> to Launchpad. It&#8217;s a Bazaar plugin that:<br /><ul><li>Finds the diff between your current branch and the submit branch</li><li>Looks in that diff for any Python comments that you&#8217;ve added or modified</li><li>Shows all the TODO or XXX items in Emacs &#8220;compile&#8221; format.</li></ul>So the output looks something like this:<br /><br />$ bzr todo<br />Using submit branch /home/jml/repos/someproject/trunk<br />lib/somefile.py:167:<br /> XXX: JonathanLange 2009-02-23: This matches the old search algorithm that used to live in foobar.py. It&#8217;s not actually very good &#8211; really it should match based on substrings of the unique name and sort based on relevance.<br /><br />lib/otherfile.py:680:<br /> XXX: This is using _cromulateSplonks &#8211; a private method that no longer exists.<br /><br />lib/anotherfile:779:<br /> XXX: I think that this can be moved into IAmAwesome.<br /><br />Things to do: 3<br /><br />The branch comes with an Emacs module bzr-todo.el. If you load this module, you can just go &#8220;M-x branch-todo&#8221; in any file in a branch and have the todo list come up in a compile buffer. Then you can just click on any item to jump straight to it.<br /><br />The core code is pretty well tested, but everything around is really, really rough. It works for me.<br /><br />I&#8217;d love some patches for it.</div>

The <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/">Launchpad branch cloud</a> has been tweaked. We got rid of the green (what does that mean anyway?) and added more variations in font size.<br /><br />Enjoy!</div>
