You might already know that I have a lot of <span style="font-style: italic;">lists</span> on my computer. I may have mentioned once or twice that I have such lists. These lists are connected to a certain popular productivity system which isn&#8217;t really about productivity and is a little bit like a cult.<br /><br />I might have also mentioned that I&#8217;ve been longing for a &#8220;smart&#8221; phone, partly so I can have these lists with me at all times, to clutch at reflexively like some Popish talisman.<br /><br />Now that I have a Palm Prē I have lists and a smart phone, and yet one does not know the other. I am at a loss as to how to get my lists — line-separated text files on my laptop — onto the Tasks application on the Palm. Even then, once they are on the Palm, I have no idea as to how to get them synchronized with something I can edit from my laptop.<br /><br />Any ideas?</div>

@intellectronica, EverNote is on the Palm, but AFAICT it isn&#39;t a task list manager, it&#39;s more of a note gathering application. Am I missing something?<br /><br />@drewpca, Cool! Although, I think I&#39;m interested in getting stuff *into* Tasks, not out of it.<br /><br />@thomasvs, I hadn&#39;t heard of yagtd, I&#39;ll have a quick play with it. May I suggest taking a look at GTG? Someone has a desktopcouch branch of that &#8211; it might be worth combining efforts rather than making yet another GTD app.</div>

I&#39;m in the same cult.  I don&#39;t know if the Palm Pre is a device that allows you to install whatever you want, but I&#39;m in the same situation with my N800 and soon N900, plus my various laptops/desktops.<br /><br />I started writing a couchdb-based GTD manager (currently command-line only, inspired on yagtd which I&#39;ve used for the last two years).  I plan to port it to the N900, which should be doable given there are couchdb packages.<br /><br />Not entirely what you&#39;re looking for, but let me know if you are interested (or anyone else here, like tekNico)</div>

I&#39;m using (on the iphone and PC) a service/product called Evernote which allows you to edit notes on the phone, on the PC (windows software but works fine with wine) and on the web. I don&#39;t know if they have a Palm version, but it they do you should give it a try.</div>

mmm.. maybe somebody can port Bazaar to the Palm Prē :)<br /><br />I have a similar problem with my G1 (also a thinkingrock user). Thinking about it, it should be possible to do the version control part from my laptop when my phone is mounted. TODO: find a text editor which can edit files in a branch on my phone.</div>

Hey Dustin,<br /><br />That sounds like a good idea. What command do you use to rsync, exactly? I get a lot of permission denied errors when I try.<br /><br />A little poking around shows that the Tasks app is backed on to an sqlite3 database. As best as I can tell, the schema lives in /usr/lib/luna/PalmDatabase.db3 and the db itself in /var/luna/data/dbdata/PalmDatabase.db3. That last one wasn&#39;t rsynced when I tried with &#39;rsync -avPx&#39;.<br /><br />Looks like tables for a bunch of apps are in there. <br /><br />Interestingly, the &#39;Task&#39; table (com_palm_pim_Task) has a column called &#39;extraCrap&#39;.</div>

Jono-<br /><br />I installed sshd on my Pre, and I rsync the entire filesystem to my laptop to back it up daily.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t looked for the backing files of the task list, if they&#39;re cleartext and edit-able.  If they are readable, then I think rsync+sshd+vi might solve this for you?<br /><br />:-Dustin</div>

&gt; These lists are connected to a certain popular<br />&gt; productivity system which isn&#39;t really about<br />&gt; productivity and is a little bit like a cult.<br /><br />Sure, brother, just say the word: GTD. ;-) I&#39;m no David Allen follower, anyway, I just own the book in both English and Italian languages. ;-P<br /><br />&gt; Any ideas?<br /><br />Nope, I&#39;m in a similar predicament. I&#39;ve been using Thinking Rock for a few years now, but it&#39;s a big, hairy Java beast, no way to put that on my Nokia N800 (nor on a N900, I guess).</div>

<div>I&#8217;m back in London after a mammoth two weeks travelling the globe bringing <a href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> joy to its four corners.</div><div><br /></div><div>First up I went to Mooloolaba, Australia. If you&#8217;re Australian, you probably know how to pronounce it. If you aren&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll probably never get it. Sorry.</div><div>I was there with the Canonical Bazaar team and some other Launchpadders, talking about their next few months of development. They are going to be focusing on helping Launchpad and the Ubuntu platform team work on our daily build initiative. Hmm. I really need a place to link to for that last one, don&#8217;t I?</div><div><br /></div><div>Mooloolaba is a beautiful place to be in November. If you are thinking of giving me something for Christmas, consider a holiday apartment there.</div><div><br /></div><div>After Mooloolaba, I crossed the Pacific to reach Dallas, home of the twenty-eight lane highway. I didn&#8217;t really get into the city that much, but man, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-L?action=show&amp;redirect=UDS">UDS</a> was great.</div><div><br /></div><div>Most of the people there are directly involved in Ubuntu development. It&#8217;s such a joy to see so many people from all over the world come together to work on Ubuntu, and an honour to think that I have a place in that work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I spent most of the conference flitting from room to room, going to sessions about the Ubuntu development process, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DailyBuilds">daily builds</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter">Software Centre</a>. Occasionally, I cheated a bit and went to a random session that interested me. Mostly it was about <a href="https://launchpad.net/quickly">Quickly</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>As a Launchpad developer, one of the most exciting things about this UDS was seeing that Ubuntu developers have started building <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/API/Uses">their own tools around Launchpad using our API</a>. Many of these tools are things we&#8217;d love to integrate with the main web app, but many are things that are <i>so</i> Ubuntu policy specific that we&#8217;re happy to leave them outside. After all, this is exactly</div><div>what the API is about.</div><div><br /></div><div>I did a short plenary session where I hacked up <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~jml/+junk/bugstats">an API script</a> using <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/API/launchpadlib">launchpadlib</a> and demonstrated it live. After the presentation, many people came up to me and started talking about their API-using programs and their experience making them. The amount of interest really surprised me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also ran a couple of workshop / discussions. The first was on improving Launchpad for API use, which was a bit disorganized, since I didn&#8217;t realize I was supposed to be running it. The second was on getting started with Launchpad hacking.</div><div><br /></div><div>For the &#8220;Getting started with Launchpad hacking&#8221; session, I passed around a USB stick, and asked the audience for an API within Launchpad to expose. <a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/">mdz</a> suggested &#8220;blueprints&#8221;, so I went to expose the &#8216;drafter&#8217; element of a specification. In front of a room full of people. Sheesh.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you think pair programming is hard (it is, and if you think it isn&#8217;t you are either doing it wrong or you have extremely helpful colleagues), programming in front of a room full of people is harder.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still, we managed to actually expose the API and <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~jml/launchpad/expose-blueprints/+merge/15060">propose the branch for merging</a> with only a little bit of evil.</div><div><br /></div><div>The point of the session was to get people set up with Launchpad development environments, to show them how to even begin to expose a method over the API but even more than that, to give people a little push into just giving Launchpad development a try. By blundering my way into a valid patch, I think maybe we succeeded.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now UDS is over and I&#8217;m back in London, jetlagged and exhausted to be sure, but genuinely happy about the plans we have for Launchpad development, and eager to begin to make them happen.</div></div>

I like unit testing a lot. I&#8217;ve recently been thinking about whether it really is everything that advocates like myself make it out to be.

For me a major benefit is that you save time. I.e you don&#39;t have to manually test something 100 times until it works correctly. You just run the test and it should be able to automatically do the test in less time than it would have taken to do it manually. With the added benefit that you can redo the test in a months time without remembering exactly how it works.<br /><br />Another advantage for me is that it gets you thinking about what exactly you are trying to do before you spend the time going in circles of implementation while you are still trying to figure out what you are trying to do.<br />Especially if you doing it right:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development</div>

&gt; What happened to doing something because it was the right thing?<br /><br />This isn&#39;t a moral issue, you won&#39;t go to hell if you didn&#39;t write any unit tests. ;-)<br /><br />Something is the right thing if the costs outweigh the benefits.  Unit tests clearly add value to the process, and for me it&#39;s just as clear that the value is greater than the cost.  Most people at least agree that testing (of some kind) reduces the time-spent-per-bug.<br /><br />I think the debate is really about the <i>opportunity</i> cost of unit testing; could we be doing some BETTER form of testing, if we weren&#39;t writing unit tests?<br /><br />For me, the answer is &quot;maybe, but I haven&#39;t heard about it yet&quot;.</div>

Sure, you don&#39;t need as many of the unit tests in a language like Haskell, because you can encode some of the constraints on behavior in the type system and the compiler will handle ensure these.<br /><br />But, I almost think I would be more inclined to do testing of at least the core structures and functions of my applications if I were in Haskell because in fact it sounds like it is easier.  With tools like QuickCheck and HPC and some more advanced checkers as well, there is a large toolkit to do so.<br /><br />I recently have been re-reading Real World Haskell and Chapter 11 Testing and Quality Assurance (http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/testing-and-quality-assurance.html) makes me feel like the cost vs benefit ratio is definitely more bang for buck.<br /><br />I also remember watching a talk by Don Stewart (and perhaps another of the xmonad developers, I can&#39;t remember right now) about the development of xmonad and the testing that went on.  It was very enlightening.<br /><br />I feel like I&#39;d be more prone to catch the TDD spirit (well, more correctly the attitude that the code isn&#39;t done until it is tested) while using Haskell than I have been using Python.  I have not, in fact, got into TDD in Python because it does seem onerous.</div>

Yes - Language is very important in this debate. Test are more important for dynamically typed languages (e.g. python), than for statically typed languages (e.g. C#.) <br /><br />For example, if you rename a method, and you don&#39;t change one of the caller of the method (cause you missed it,) the static language will pick this up at compile time, but with the dynamic language, if you don&#39;t have tests, it&#39;s going to show up later as a bug.</div>

I gatecrashed LugRadio Live last Saturday and went to an excellent talk by Matthew Paul Thomas about reporting usability problems. Matthew has reported <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-importance&amp;search=Search&amp;field.status:list=NEW&amp;field.status:list=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status:list=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;field.status:list=INVALID&amp;field.status:list=WONTFIX&amp;field.status:list=CONFIRMED&amp;field.status:list=TRIAGED&amp;field.status:list=INPROGRESS&amp;field.status:list=FIXCOMMITTED&amp;field.status:list=FIXRELEASED&amp;assignee_option=any&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.bug_reporter=mpt&amp;field.bug_supervisor=&amp;field.bug_commenter=&amp;field.subscriber=&amp;field.omit_dupes.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes=on&amp;field.has_patch.used=&amp;field.has_cve.used=&amp;field.tag=&amp;field.tags_combinator=ANY">well over a thousand bugs against Launchpad itself</a> (many of which <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-importance&amp;search=Search&amp;field.status:list=FIXCOMMITTED&amp;field.status:list=FIXRELEASED&amp;assignee_option=any&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.bug_reporter=mpt&amp;field.bug_supervisor=&amp;field.bug_commenter=&amp;field.subscriber=&amp;field.omit_dupes.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes=on&amp;field.has_patch.used=&amp;field.has_cve.used=&amp;field.tag=&amp;field.tags_combinator=ANY">have been fixed</a>) so he knows something about the subject.<div><br /></div><div>Matthew gave six pointers on how to report usability problems, but for me the single most striking one was this:</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Raise your standards</b></div><br />When you are using an application with the aim of improving its usability, you need to shed all of your tolerance and forget those many workarounds you&#8217;ve learned.

Really though, that&#8217;s not good enough. I should work until the thing I&#8217;ve added is invisible, or at least fun to use.

Be a perfectionist when testing/reporting usability problems and a pragmatist when planning your work and scheduling your releases. The trap of perfectionism is really a trap of poor planning. If you allow yourself to tinker with whatever has your attention at the moment, you&#39;ll never reach a stable place. Raising your standards means never being completely happy with a release.</div>

Every time somebody asks me what I think we should do for a sprint, I try to suggest &#8220;fix as many bugs as possible&#8221;.<div><br /></div><div>Each of the Launchpad teams gets together in a single location for a week long &#8220;sprint&#8221; fairly regularly. Maybe each team has two sprints a year.</div><div><br /></div><div>Often these sprints end up being long talking sessions where designs for features are thrashed out. That&#8217;s great and all, and sprints are a rare opportunity to do that, but often the design work goes unused for months while the team deals with the work already on its collective plate.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sometimes these sprints have the whole team working (i.e. coding) toward a single milestone, be it a release or a major feature. These sprints are fun, but they&#8217;ve been quite rare for Launchpad. (Bazaar had a great one in Brisbane earlier this year).</div><div><br /></div><div>What I&#8217;d love to see is a sprint where people fixed as many bugs as possible. Perhaps as a product strategist, I ought to be advocating higher-level visions and responding to the market and so forth, rather than saying &#8220;fix lots of bugs&#8221;. But I don&#8217;t think so, at least, not yet.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fixing as many bugs as we can in a fixed time frame will make many users happy, since behind each bug is a user in pain. It will make us happy as a team, since a vastly dropped bug count will make us feel less overwhelmed and will feel like a concrete achievement. It&#8217;s an easy sprint to measure the success of, and my hunch is that it would be a fun sprint too. It&#8217;s also substantially different to what we normally do, which adds to the fun.</div><div><br /></div><div>What do you think? I&#8217;d love to hear from people in community-driven open source projects, as well as people within Canonical who aren&#8217;t in Launchpad. Maybe we&#8217;re missing something that others know about.</div></div>

I think part of the problem is that two sprints a year is too few.  On the Landscape team we do things a bit differently: we have 4 sprints a year and each one is 2 weeks (so maybe they&#39;re more like marathons).  We distinguish planning sprints from coding sprints and generally interleave these two things.<br /><br />We&#39;ve aligned our development process with Ubuntu&#39;s 6 month cycle, so this works quite well.  We get together at UDS for a &quot;planning sprint&quot; where we work out what we want to accomplish in the next six months.  When we get home we all start working on whatever features have been discussed.  These sprints are also a great time to review development process and other non-coding aspects of the project.<br /><br />Typically in the middle of the 6 month cycle we have a &quot;coding sprint&quot;.  These sprints are usually about moving forward whatever tasks we&#39;ve been working on, but sometimes they focus on other things like getting the client prepared for release, or stabilizing code that&#39;s been undergoing a lot of churn.<br /><br />We divide these 6-month cycles into 1-month milestones.  One of the ways we deal with bug accumulation is to explicitly use the 6th milestone as polish/bug fix time.</div>

Debian do this with their Bug Squashing Parties (BSPs). When approaching a release they run these to get the number of RC bugs down.<br /><br />http://wiki.debian.org/BSP<br /><br />I agree that this could be a good use of sprints. For instance, bzr currently has 1733 open bugs, around half of those ever reported and more than are marked &quot;Fix Released.&quot; That&#39;s quite a lot of pain points, though I feel many were transient, since fixed or extreme edge cases.<br /><br />[ Hey, this would be a better conversation if LP produced graphs of these numbers over time. ]<br /><br />Bugfixing often requires you to do feature work, or at least re-architect some area, so discussions around the best way to do this would be good for sprints.<br /><br />Also, there is a question of how to pick the bugs, for Debian it is quite easy, there is a list and all must be dealt with, what should other projects do? Work from the top of the list down in terms of priority?<br /><br />I think it would be good if tags were used extensively, so you could look at all the bugs related to “dirstate,” or “log,” and try and fix swathes of bugs in one go. Also, if all bugs had executable test cases then you would get TDD for free.<br /><br />Or, in short, “I agree.”<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />James</div>

Launchpad has a pretty awesome <a href="http://edge.launchpad.net/+apidoc">public API</a>, implemented using <a href="https://launchpad.net/lazr.restful">lazr.restful</a>.

Back in the day, I used to want to use <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/options.html">twisted.python.usage</a> for all of my command-line apps. It&#8217;s a fairly nice <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.python.usage.html">API</a> &amp; a good way of writing code.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Since I started writing Bazaar plugins though, I&#8217;ve fallen in love with Bazaar&#8217;s command interface. <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~jkakar">Jamu</a> has too, so he wrote <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/commandant">Commandant</a>. I don&#8217;t really understand it though, which is mostly for lack of trying.</div><div><br /></div><div>Michael turned our internal EC2-using testing tool into a bzr-a-like app <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/stable/annotate/head:/lib/devscripts/ec2test/builtins.py">using the Bazaar APIs</a>. There&#8217;s a bit of duplication, but it works pretty well.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Bazaar developers are aware that their command-line interface code rocks and that it&#8217;s too closely bound to Bazaar. I&#8217;m not sure whether anyone has filed bugs about it or not, but here&#8217;s what I actually want:</div><div><ul><li>The subcommand interface, e.g. &#8220;bzr foo&#8221;</li><li>Option parsing</li><li>Help</li><li>Command aliasing</li><li>Error handling</li><li>Progress display</li><li>Verbosity control&nbsp;</li><li>Logging</li><li>Debug helpers (e.g. The way bzr handles Ctrl-\)</li></ul><div>There&#8217;s also a bunch of cool stuff in Bazaar that&#8217;s useful for a lot of applications, command-line or not.</div><div><ul><li>Registries</li><li>Transports</li><li>Hooks</li><li>Configuration files</li><li>Oh yeah, <b>plugins</b>.

Just stuff that&#8217;s been on my mind that I wanted to write down and publish.

Thanks bignose, I hadn&#39;t heard of that one. I&#39;ll take a look at it.<br /><br />I agree that a progress bar is separate from a command-line parser, but it&#39;s not separate from a command-line app toolkit. I could have made my point better, but what I meant is that Bazaar has a great command-line app toolkit begging to be separated from the dvcs bits.</div>

Most of the features you list are available with the popular <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse" rel="nofollow">argparse</a> library.<br /><br />As for “progress bar”, I don&#39;t think that belongs much in a command-line parser library; a separate facility for progress bar output seems more suitable.</div>

Dammit. I wrote a reply which then got lost.<br /><br />Here it is again, from memory.<br /><br />Jamu, as I said, I&#39;ve only ever had a fairly shallow look at Commandant. Here are a few things from skimming the README:<br /><br /> * I don&#39;t want to have to use shell aliases to have my program be called by its proper name.<br /><br /> * I dislike the idea of putting files in a directory to get commands. I&#39;d much rather an explicit registry.<br /><br /> * I don&#39;t want the word &quot;Commandant&quot; appearing in the output of my program.<br /><br />Maybe what all of this means is that I was looking for a library, and the README makes it look more like a framework. This is all rather shallow, of course, since I still haven&#39;t actually tried to use it in anger.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />jml</div>

I want to add support to Commandant for command aliasing (which implies some kind of configuration file handling), progress display and plugins.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#39;error handling&#39;, but at present Commandant displays str(exception) when an exception is raised by a command.<br /><br />If you have any advice on how to make it easier to figure out what Commandant is for, I&#39;d love to hear it.  Also, thanks for publicizing Commandant!</div>

This seems like the kind of thing a bounty would be good for, actually.<br /><br />I&#39;m generally pretty sceptical of bounties: &quot;here&#39;s $200 to do $3000 worth of software development, oh, and we&#39;ll haggle over standards just as much as we would if we were paying $3000.&quot; But this sort of task strikes me as fairly well defined, unlikely to blow out significantly in estimates, a bit low priority and unexciting for core volunteers, potentially high impact in terms of users.</div>
