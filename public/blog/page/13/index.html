Last week the Launchpad team leads gathered in London and had an absolutely huge meeting. Fifteen or sixteen smart, opinionated &amp; passionate people in a room talking about the next six months of Launchpad development. It was a lot of fun.<br /><br />When planning the agenda, Martin Albisetti and I were a little worried about things wandering off track, so we thrashed out a lists of dos &amp; don&#8217;ts. I&#8217;ll blurt them out here, with the really terrible ideas filtered out so I look more clever, and then offer some thoughts on how they worked.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do</span><br /><ul><li>be happy with the results of this meeting.</li><li>ask questions, especially &#8220;why&#8221;</li><li>be punctual</li><li>stay on point</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don&#8217;t<br /></span><ul><li>design features</li><li>check your email, i.e. laptops closed<br /></li><li>leave the meeting without being clear</li><li>leave the meeting without being happy</li></ul>The &#8220;laptops closed&#8221; one didn&#8217;t work so well. It was great for the first couple of days, but by Thursday afternoon there were always people in a corner with those open LCD screens sucking chi out of the room like little dragons of despair.<br /><br />The &#8220;Don&#8217;t design features&#8221; rule was awesome. The rationale is that feature design leads to long discussions, and that it does a disservice to the many excellent engineers we have who aren&#8217;t at the meeting and will be actually implementing a feature. At best, it&#8217;s waste and at worst it&#8217;s us telling people how to do something that they know how to do better. The clearest sign that it was a good idea came when other people started using it to shut me up.</div>

FWIW, we deliberately scheduled an hour of &quot;unstructured&quot; time into each day.<br /><br />Mary, although I can&#39;t speak for the others, you describe exactly how I&#39;ve felt at these things in the past, and yes, it is draining. Although I can&#39;t think of any right now, perhaps there are more considerate ways of handling this than opening up your laptop.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I also had my laptop open inappropriately at some points of the meeting, and bear absolutely no ill will towards anyone there who did the same.</div>

Re email checking, I don&#39;t know exactly how you set it up, but maybe there&#39;s an introversion problem with these sprint meetings.<br /><br />You get a bunch of people, many of whom (I think) work from home. They&#39;ve travelled, they might be sharing a hotel room, they&#39;re spending all day having high stakes, high bandwidth face-to-face interactions. They socialise all evening. They sleep. They go round again. It may be pretty draining especially compared to their usual quota of human interaction.<br /><br />So it may be that some of them are trying to create some downtime for themselves by laptopping. I don&#39;t have a good solution given the expense of these meetings.</div>

I wonder what to do about the &quot;laptops not closed&quot; problem.  I guess the solution depends on the cause&#8230;<br /><br /><i>Email genuinely backing up and needs to be dealt with?</i>  That certainly sounds plausible after several days.  Allocate some time for catching up on demands from the outside world.<br /><br /><i>Meeting fatigue — after several days of intense discussion perhaps some people&#39;s capacity for engaging in intense discussion is simply exhausted?</i>  Not sure what to do about this except for taking more time or doing less, neither of which is satisfactory.  Or finding a way when planning the week to accomodate the inevitable reduced energy towards the end, e.g. shorter sessions and more breaks?<br /><br /><i>Some participants don&#39;t think the current topic is very relevant to them, or that their involvement is superfluous?</i>  There&#39;s a pretty important disconnect there&#8230; why did they attend in the first place, and why were they invited?  If circumstances have changed since the meeting attendees were chosen then maybe there needs to be a way for people to gracefully uninvite themselves.<br /><br />Put another way, if someone&#39;s laptop is not closed, why don&#39;t they just excuse themselves and leave the room entirely?  Perhaps there&#39;s no just obvious way to do that politely.  Or perhaps they feel obliged to be there, but simultaneously don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s a good use of their time (maybe just because they have meeting fatigue).  That&#39;s a pretty serious problem, and definitely a vibe-sucking one, and I&#39;d love to know a good solution.<br /><br />Maybe next time quietly approach a culprit during a break and ask them as non-judgementally as possible why they&#39;ve started opening their laptop during a meeting?</div>

I&#8217;ve been working on the Launchpad team for a while, with most of that time being in Australia.

Here&#39;s another one: people outside of your local area won&#39;t necessarily know when or if you observe daylight saving.<br /><br />If you schedule a recurring meeting according to a time zone that observes DST, then don&#39;t be surprised if people get confused around the transition times.</div>

“Use 24 hour time”: yes. Also, use ISO-8601 date formats, i.e. 2009-10-07. It&#39;s unambiguous between locales, *and* you get to know what year the writer was talking about.<br /><br />Why are USAians so averse to putting the danged *year* in their dates?</div>

Michael, Mary, yes, avoiding local abbreviations&quot; is important.<br /><br />I wish I thought of the &quot;today&quot; thing.</div>

Also, some of the local timezone acronyms are ambiguous: both USians and Australians call their eastern time zone EST/EDT.<br /><br />So, what Michael said.</div>

I think all of those things are very good bits of advice, although I&#39;d perhaps have put them in a different order.  The one I&#39;d really like to bash into people&#39;s heads is to either give times in UTC or local time &amp; UTC offset.  I can never remember what EDT or PST and so on are.<br /><br />I would also say:<br /><br /> * be careful talking about days, particularly when close the date line.  My Tuesday is not the same as Jamu&#39;s Tuesday, or at least not for very long.<br /><br /> * DST sucks bright red donkey balls.</div>

Launchpad does translations. You can register a project on Launchpad and use Launchpad to translate your software into a zillion other languages. We&#8217;ve even got funky tools to take the translations that people do on the web and commit them straight to your branch.<br /><br />As an ignorant Anglophonic monoglot, I&#8217;ve never really looked into Launchpad Translations. Software is already written in my language, and I can&#8217;t help translate it into my language. There has been no reason for me to look at it&#8230; until today.<br /><br />Barry Warsaw, hacker extraordinaire, has started a project called <a href="https://launchpad.net/colon-full-of-cookie">I have a colon full of cookie</a>. This project aims to translate the phrase &#8220;I have a colon full of cookie&#8221; into as many languages as possible. Note here that &#8220;colon&#8221; is the organ, not the punctuation mark.<br /><br />OK, time to bust out my Latin lexicon.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
When I talk about testing frameworks, I often mention Zope layers and say they are terrible. Some people have asked me for details on their terror and for justification of my opinion.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s based on my experiences using layers with Zope 3.2 in Launchpad.<br /><br /><b>1. Layers have unnecessary magic</b><br /><br />A layer can subclass another layer, which is fine. Subclassing means that your new, derived layer rests on top of the old, base layer.<br /><br />When you define a derived layer though, you don&#8217;t call the base layer&#8217;s methods yourself, like you would for any other Python subclass. Why not? Because zope.testing magically up-calls the base layer&#8217;s methods for you.<br /><br />Yuck.<br /><br />The upshot is that you write non-standard Python that confuses people not familiar with zope.testing. Also, you have no way of <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> calling the base methods, which is unfairly restrictive.<br /><br /><b>2. Layers are combined through inheritance</b><br /><br />Each unit test is in a single layer. If you want a unit test to have the set up and tear down provided by layer A <i>and</i> the set up and tear down of layer B, you have to define a wholly new layer C that subclasses both A and B.<br /><br />The layer C doesn&#8217;t really mean anything other than &#8220;A and B&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t really deserve a name, but it has to have one, since it has to be a new class.<br /><br />Since layers are often used to share expensive resources between tests, you end up with a binary explosion of layer subclasses, as you move toward needing one for every subset of available resources.<br /><br />This adds code and thus maintenance work, and is actually less clear than simply declaring that a test uses layers A and B.<br /><br /><b>3. Layers are implemented badly</b><br /><br />Layers are all about changing the way a test is run. They supplement the run with extra work to establish a known base state for the test.<br /><br />If you think about it, the stuff that&#8217;s required to run a test is a property of the test.<br /><br />Python&#8217;s <code>unittest</code> module recognizes this. One of the few public methods of a <code>TestCase</code> object is its <code>run()</code> method. <code>run()</code> is also a method of <code>TestSuite</code>. This means that if you want to customize the way a test or a group of tests is run, you should override / re-implement the <code>run()</code> method.<br /><br />Layers don&#8217;t do this. Instead they change the way tests are gathered, the way they are reported <i>and</i> the way they are run. This means tests that rely on layers can only be run with the Zope test runner, and not with nose or trial or what have you.<br /><br /><b>4. Layers solve too many problems</b><br /><br />Layers are not simply a way of sharing expensive resources between tests, they are also a way of using resources that cannot be torn down.<br /><br />The implementation does this by detecting that a layer cannot be torn down, then spawning a new process to run the rest of the tests in.<br /><br />It kind of sucks to have things that cannot be torn down in process, and it definitely sucks to conflate resource sharing with odd subprocess management.<br /><br /><b>5. Layers are not Zopish</b><br /><br />As far as I can tell, one of the themes of Zope 3 is small, interchangeable pieces loosely joined together.<br /><br />Layers seem to be something that could have been done much better using the Zope component architecture. Perhaps they could give <code>getUtility</code> some practical purpose in life.<br /><br /><b>What then?</b><br /><br />As much as I hate to say so, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much hope for layers as a concept. One is probably better served by replacing one&#8217;s existing layers with <a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a>. It looks like it takes <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-foundations/+bug/419691/comments/2">quite a lot of work to do so</a>.<br /><br />That&#8217;s it. Five reasons and a lot of paragraphs. Please let me know if I&#8217;ve made mistakes, or if newer versions of zope.testing are better. Also, please gently correct me if I&#8217;ve left the path of <a href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/47657.html">civility and common courtesy</a>.</div>

The punted alternative right now is:<br /><br />http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testresources<br /><br />&#8230;which sadly seems to be lacking on the docs and examples front.</div>

Hi jml,<br /><br />I&#39;ve never used Layers, but these points seem right.  One thing that I find missing from this post is a discussion of some of the alternatives.  For example, I know I am sometimes tempted to add new methods to TestCase and require the runner to find them.  It&#39;s not always obvious how to add features without expanding the interface.  When I started writing this post, I had an example of this, but then it slipped away from me.  Oops.</div>

You might remember I was really excited about the first version of the active reviews page, since it let me see at a glance the code reviews I needed to do, the ones I was waiting on, and reviews I could do if I felt like it. At the time, this was really important, since it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen a code collaboration tool orient itself towards me actually doing things. It&#8217;s certainly a first for Launchpad.<br /><br />Tim has recently landed a few changes to the page that aren&#8217;t quite as revolutionary, but follow the same lines of thinking.<br /><br />The one I want to mention is putting all the branches that are approved for landing onto the active reviews page. Every branch that&#8217;s approved to land and hasn&#8217;t yet landed is actually waste, it&#8217;s an improvement that&#8217;s sitting around gathering dust and waiting for someone to push a button. It&#8217;s like a winning lottery ticket stuck to your fridge because you&#8217;re too lazy to cash it in. We think it&#8217;s so important that we&#8217;ve put these at the top of the list.<br /><br />You can take a look at the active reviews pages for:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/+activereviews">Jonathan Lange</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/launchpad/+activereviews">Jonathan Lange in Launchpad</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad/+activereviews">Launchpad</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/people/+me/+activereviews">Yourself</a></li></ul>Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have branches to land.</div>

I&#39;m very happy they&#39;re all now on one fridge, not stuck in the bottom drawer.<br /><br />https://code.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+activereviews<br /><br />The first three headings<br /><br />&quot;Approved reviews ready to land&quot;<br />&quot;Requested reviews I can do&quot;<br />&quot;Reviews I am waiting on&quot;<br /><br />all sound pretty clear<br /><br />&quot;Reviews I am doing&quot; presumably means it is somehow stuck to me like the tar baby.  I don&#39;t know how to get things off this list - I already voted on them.<br /><br />&quot;Other reviews I am not actively reviewing&quot; is just a long way of saying &quot;Other&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what I should do with these things.  I&#39;m waiting on them, I&#39;m not reviewing them, and they&#39;re not reviews I can do.  In theory.  But really these are all reviews on my project so I should be able to do something with them.</div>

Why does your personal code review page have a nice little version of your profile pic and mine has the generic person icon?<br /><br />Is there some setting for this that I can&#39;t seem to find?<br /><br />Or I&#39;m just avatar unlucky? :)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/robertc/">Robert Collins</a> of <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bazaar</a>, recently blogged about the <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/robertc/diary/113.html">cost of slow tests</a>. I couldn&#8217;t agree more.<br /><br /><a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> has a very slow test suite. It takes upwards of five hours to get a change into <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad-pqm/launchpad/stable">our &#8220;known good&#8221; branch</a>. It&#8217;s been a source of pain for the team for years, and now that Launchpad is Free Software, it&#8217;s becoming a pain to new contributors.<br /><br />We&#8217;ve tried a few things to deal with it, none of them great. First up, we&#8217;ve got  a tool for running the test suite on EC2 instances. It&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s still too slow. I&#8217;ve written a &#8221;<a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/FasterTests">faster tests</a>&#8221; spec outlining some of the options we have; but specs never got software written. Likewise, there are a bunch of bugs flagged as <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+bugs?field.tag=build-infrastructure">build-infrastructure</a>, many of which address the slow test sped. We also have a rotating &#8221;<a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/BuildEngineer">Build Engineer</a>&#8221; position within the team to address those bugs.<br /><br /><span style="display: block;" id="formatbar_Buttons"><span class=" on down" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);">It&#8217;s probably not enough though. From watching Rob&#8217;s blog posts, and the emails to the Bazaar mailing list, I think that what Launchpad really needs is someone with a passion for solving the problem (i.e. making Launchpad hacking fun) who is willing to lead the way, and a full commitment from the rest of the team for getting the runtime down and keeping it there.<br /><br />More on this later.<br /></span></span></div>

We&#39;re not completely stupid, of course we have a way to limit the tests we run between code edits :)  Although this tends to also be too slow because of excessively general fixture setup&#8230;</div>

5 hours! Wow!<br /><br />5 minutes is too much.  To run some tests between code edits, 50s is really pushing it.<br /><br />My preferred method of development is to run the one test or TestCase that exercises the code I&#39;m working on, and trial has no problems doing that.  When I think I&#39;m fine with that, then run the entire test suite.  Does Launchpad lack a good way to do that?<br /><br />If I can&#39;t make-a-change-run-a-test in about a 10 second cycle, there&#39;s something wrong with my development environment and I won&#39;t rest until it&#39;s fixed &#8230;</div>

I spoke at <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2009</a> in Birmingham about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> module in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/index.html">Python standard library</a>.<br /><br />The central thesis was first proposed to me by Robert Collins, probably around 2003 or 2004. The idea is that unittest is actually surprisingly good and more extensible than you think. It was also Rob&#8217;s idea to co-present this as a talk in Birmingham. Sadly, I was obliged to present it by myself.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to write up the talk more thoroughly, and am keen to publish brief posts on why layers are bad and why setUpClass is bad, but for now I&#8217;ll just post the artifacts from EuroPython.<br /><ul><li>Slides (<a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/EuroPython-2009-unittest-jml.odp">ODP</a> | <a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/EuroPython-2009-unittest-jml.pdf">PDF</a>)<br /></li><li><a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/unittest-lets-fix-it-slides.txt">Text version of slides</a></li><li><a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/unittest-lets-fix-it.txt">Notes</a></li><li><a href="http://static.mumak.net/Jonathan_Lange-Unittest_It_aint_broke_lets_fix_it.ogg">Audio</a> (<a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/RecordedTalks?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Jonathan_Lange-Unittest_It_aint_broke_lets_fix_it.ogg">mirror</a>)<br /></li></ul>What do you think?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: Audio now available.</div>

I agree. As I mentioned in the original post, I would love to turn this into a paper.</div>

I think we need something that glues together slides and audio. Now, they do not interact and it is not fun to follow this presentation that seems very valuable.<br /><br />What presentation gurus say is that the handout is different document from the speech and different from the slides also. It is a third document which needs its own hours of design and tuning.</div>
