Oh, thanks for that. Would never have guessed to look for a generic Launchpad helper in ubuntu-dev-tools.</div>

This script looks nice but did you consider adding it to lp-shell which is packaged in ubuntu-dev-tools and originally written by Pitti?</div>

Long time readers will know of my attempts to get Ubuntu running on my iMac. Now that I&#8217;m working within the Ubuntu Engineering team at Canonical, I figured it would be a good time to try again.<br /><br />Installing natively fails on 11.04 in the same way that it failed on 10.10: the installer sends output to the Mini DisplayPort rather than the actual screen. I don&#8217;t have an external monitor that I can hook up to the DisplayPort, so that&#8217;s pretty much that.<br /><br />I can still run a VM, right? VirtualBox is pretty good, and I got me a running install of Ubuntu with the Unity shell without too much fuss. Problem comes with keyboard configuration. The literal keypresses Cmd+H and Cmd+Q are not passed through to the guest OS. With a Dvorak layout these become Cmd+D and Cmd+&#8221;, and if one maps Cmd to Meta then you cannot easily kill-word in Emacs. That means for me to have a useful environment, I&#8217;d have to make do with Super and Meta swapped around from the usual PC layout.<br /><br />VM Fusion doesn&#8217;t have this problem and has a nicer UI, but I can&#8217;t run Unity or compiz under it. This makes Ubuntu feel really old and clunky, and I&#8217;d rather not do that.<br /><br />Parallels, well, at this point I&#8217;m running out of the will.<br /><br />Think I&#8217;ll settle on VirtualBox for the time being.</div>

After four and a half years of working on <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>, I&#8217;m moving on within Canonical, taking a <a href="http://t.co/R37ybBu">position</a> on the Ubuntu Engineering team, working to get more and better apps on <a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.<br /><br />I am very excited about the change, but also a little sad, since it will mean leaving what has been <i>the</i> best team I&#8217;ve worked on.  They are a wonderful bunch of people who not only get a lot of great stuff done, but consistently surprise me with their constant drive to get better at what they do.<br /><br />Over the last couple of years, we have changed the way we are organized so that we can focus on building a small number of features at a time, the features that we do churn out are much, much better, we are rolling out new versions of Launchpad multiple times a week and we are actually paying off technical debt.<br /><br />And they&#8217;ve needed to: Launchpad is a massive, ambitious application.  I&#8217;ve never worked on something so big that aims to do so much, and with so few people actually hacking on it.<br /><br />I still care a lot about Launchpad, It&#8217;s crammed with potential and has so much to offer the open source world. It&#8217;s going to be hard for me to move on.<br /><br />But, wow, what a place to move on to, and what a time to do it. Ubuntu is aiming to go from about 20 million users to about 200 million, and to do that is going to need way, way more apps than they have now.  To do <i>that</i>, we&#8217;ll need a spiffing developer programme, and that&#8217;s where I come in. I&#8217;ll be loading up on information, plans and more concrete goals in a couple of week&#8217;s time in Dublin, and will share them as I can.<br /><br />Oh, and if you want to guide the world&#8217;s <a href="https://launchpad.net/">best open source development collaboration platform</a> into the future, do drop me or <a href="https://launchpad.net/~flacoste">Francis Lacoste</a> a line.</div>

It&#8217;s way too hard to keep all of my music stored on one machine in a lossless format, have it backed up to another machine, synced to my iPod in MP3 and have it pleasingly playable on my OS X computer. Way too hard. Really.<br />Especially since fixes to track listings and so forth seem to vanish like smoke in the breeze.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
There&#8217;s a habit within Canonical on expressing agreement and disagreement numerically. If we agree with something someone says in email or IRC, we&#8217;ll often say &#8220;+1&#8221;, which means &#8220;I agree!&#8221; or &#8220;if we were to vote about this, you would have my vote&#8221;. I sometimes hear people actually say the words &#8220;plus one&#8221; in conversation.<br /><br />Some have extrapolated from this to say &#8220;-1&#8221; to mean &#8220;I disagree&#8221;, which is a pretty natural thing to do. However, it confuses me a lot.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">You see, the &#8220;+1&#8221; thing is a little bit like the&nbsp;<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dev/guidelines.html">Apache voting system</a>, which I met in my early days of open source, back when I lurked on the Subversion development mailing list. The voting rules there were burned into my mind, and I foolishly assume that they are equally fundamental to everyone else.</div><br /><br />In the Apache system, &#8220;-1&#8221; means &#8220;veto&#8221;, which is a very strong way of disagreeing. When people on the Launchpad say &#8220;-1&#8221;, I never really know what they mean. I don&#8217;t blame them, &#8220;-1&#8221; is a bit of a silly way of vetoing a proposal. I bet if keyboards had a key for&nbsp;∞, there&#8217;d be a much more sensible way.<br /><br />I guess the moral of the story is, &#8220;ambiguous shorthand is ambiguous&#8221;.<br /><br />Incidentally, how does the Apache voting system work out in practice these days?</div>

The numerical voting system is widely and currently used in the Python ecosystem.<br /><br />The meanings are (from [0]):<br /><br />    +1 I like it<br /><br />    +0 I don&#39;t care, but go ahead<br /><br />    -0 I don&#39;t care, so why bother?<br /><br />    -1 I hate it<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />[0] http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0010/</div>

I don&#39;t have any experience of voting numerically outside of Canonical, but I have never considered -1 as a veto, except where unanimous consent is sought (but I can&#39;t remember being part of a vote like that). By that I mean that it has never even occurred to me! My assumption has always been that <i>agreement = sum(votes) &gt; 0</i>, with +0 and -0 being a non-influencing way to express inclination.</div>

For bzr, we always required no -1 votes, which lead to the -0 vote. (I&#39;m against this, but not enough to block it.)<br /><br />Of course, we also had the +0 (I think it is interesting, but not sure it should be accepted.), etc.<br /><br />Though we switched to words pretty quickly. I still really miss the &quot;BB:tweak&quot; vote. (Land it with some small changes.)</div>

A quick read through of the apache rules says -1 is a veto only if consensus is required. While we like consensus, we don&#39;t seem to require it on LP, if there&#39;s broad agreement and a few holdouts. So in that context, the -1 makes sense as disagreement.<br /><br />But largely, I agree with deryck; I&#39;ve seldom seen -1 used as veto in practice.</div>

Thing is, there are plenty of things that I disagree with but would not veto, even if I had the power.  Use of veto (or even saying &quot;I&#39;d veto this if I could&quot;) costs a certain amount of rhetorical capital.</div>

I think the ambiguity is because in practice no one uses -1 to mean veto.  -1 is just a vote against.  Whether or not you use it as veto is subject to the terms of your voting agreement. :-)  I&#39;ve only known Apache to use it as a veto.</div>

I mentioned <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/and-then-what.html">a while ago</a> that I really want to see something like a dashboard in Launchpad, some kind of view that shows you everything that you <i>must</i>&nbsp;do, everything that you are waiting on from others and&nbsp;all of your current work-in-progress. Launchpad could do this really well, since it has rich, inter-linked data about what&#8217;s going on and since it can show you this information for all of your projects.<br /><br />Today, I knocked up a very quick-and-dirty prototype for this. It shows all of the work-in-progress for a person across all of Launchpad, grouped by project.<br /><br />The code lives at <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/+junk/whip">lp:~jml/+junk/whip</a> and you can see examples of <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jml/jml-wip.html">my work-in-progress</a> and <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jml/jelmer-wip.html">jelmer&#8217;s work-in-progress</a> online. You should be able to make your own with &#8216;./bin/whip $LP-NAME &gt; wip.html&#8217;. Note that there&#8217;ll be some PYTHONPATH shenanigans.<br /><br />Hackers, I&#8217;d love to see if you could turn this prototype into a web-app, or even a page on Launchpad. There&#8217;s a NOTES file in there with whatever ideas I&#8217;ve had.<br /><br />Designers, there&#8217;s got to be a better way of showing this data than what I&#8217;ve picked. Take a look at the examples and see what you can turn them into.</div>
