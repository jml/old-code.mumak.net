Python 2.7 breaks a fair bit of code vs 2.6. At least for a significant code base. And 2.6 did the same vs 2.5 before that.<br /><br />In experience, it <i>is</i> possible to write code that can run on 2.4-2.6(7) at the same time. But it almost never works that way from the start.</div>

Although I love TDD, I don&#8217;t always use it for everything. I wrote a Python script the other day to clean up my music collection, and I didn&#8217;t write any tests for it.<br /><br />Someone asked me, what&#8217;s the trade-off? At what point do you start writing tests?<br /><br />For me, it&#8217;s at one of a few points:<br /><br /><ul><li>Somewhere between 100-200 lines of code I start feeling the need for tests</li><li>When I start feeling unclear in my head, I reach to tests to make them clear</li><li>If someone wants to work with me, tests instantly become mandatory</li><li>When I come back to some code after a while</li><li>When I notice my first bug</li></ul><div>What about you? Do you always do TDD? Do you have any rules-of-thumb for when you do?</div></div>

Usually not at the right time.<br /><br />Sometimes I start too early (before I write my first line of code) and it slows down my progress too much, causing me to get distracted before I have a working initial version that would keep me interested.<br /><br />Sometimes I start too late and that means I have to do a lot of refactoring and after-the-fact writing of tests. Often this is at a point where I have spent more time then necessary in a debugger trying to figure out which layer of my code is buggy.</div>

When a program gets big enough that I have to perform more than 2 manual actions (commands, clicks, hits to an URL).<br /><br />If I can get ~100% coverage and instant repeatability by simply re-running the program (script) then there&#39;s no point to an automated test suite; the program is effectively testing itself.  But, once I need to do five, six, or seven things in order to start testing it comprehensively, I will start forgetting some of the steps, doing some of them wrong, or occasionally skipping them, and maintenance difficulties set in.<br /><br />Pretty much any non-trivial program fits into this category, of course.  But many trivial programs of the &quot;rename a bunch of audio files&quot; variety are easy to test just by having some stub input and re-running it until the output looks right.</div>

I&#8217;m in the middle of releasing <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> 10.1, following the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess">procedure document</a> that I wrote when I released <a href="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2010/03/twisted-1000-released.html">Twisted 10.0</a>. Having everything written down has been a wonderful aide so far, but doing the release twice has made me think about what it takes to breathe life into old procedure.<br /><br />The very first step has already been taken, <i>figure out what the process is and write it down.</i>&nbsp;There are still some bits that are unknown and hazy, but I expect they&#8217;ll be clear by the time we&#8217;re done. Anyway, writing things down is only the beginning, after that, there are two things that I think we ought to do roughly concurrently.<br /><br />The first is <i>automate the existing procedure </i>for which here are already <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;group=status&amp;milestone=regular-releases">many tickets filed</a>, and the second is <i>simplify the process itself</i>. Are all of the steps in the process really needed? Why do we have so many tarballs? Why upload the tarballs to a server that is only periodically mirrored by the actual official download location? Why generate a PDF?<br /><br />I don&#8217;t want to start a discussion on the details here, but rather raise the need for Twisted to begin considering this simplification, and for myself to begin articulating some of my own thoughts about process in general.<br /><br />The final, on-going step in revitalizing procedure is to <i>delegate the task</i>, either to another human being or better yet a machine. I wonder if it would be possible to have the Twisted release done by a monthly cronjob?<br /><br />In summary, to revive an existing process:<br /><br /><ul><li>Figure out what the process is and write it down</li><li>Simplify the process itself, reducing the number of steps</li><li>Automate as many of the steps as possible, thus combining them</li><li>Delegate the execution of the process</li></ul><div><br /></div></div>

Glyph, that&#39;s a good idea. I wonder if a reason per artifact would be more useful than a reason per step, though.<br /><br />Cory, definitely. There&#39;s always going to be human steps involved. The trick is not eliminating them but reducing their number and making each step easy to do and hard to screw up.<br /><br />Steve, I have no idea what you mean. I was thinking like a programmer when I did this :)</div>

<em>Are all of the steps in the process really needed?  Why do we have so many tarballs? &#8230; Why generate a PDF?</em><br /><br />As a step along the way to simplification, I think that perhaps we should answer these questions explicitly, and not just as a rhetorical device where &quot;why&#8230;&quot; means &quot;let&#39;s not&#8230;&quot;. :).<br /><br />In fact, generally speaking, <em>every</em> step in the release process should include an explanation of why it&#39;s necessary.  Why do we run `change-versions`?  To update the version number in a mechanical way so that we won&#39;t miss any instances of it.  Why do we sign the tarballs?  To provide a way for distributors to verify that the release they&#39;ve got was the same release we released securely.  Even the &quot;quote of the release&quot; ought to serve a purpose, if it involves work for the release manager!  That way, if something else in the process changes, we have a good way of looking at any particular step and saying &quot;in light of these changes, does it still serve its intended purpose?&quot;</div>

One thing that I&#39;ve found useful in release automation is *not* to try too hard to automate things that should be done by a human.  In places there will be parts of your process such as &quot;post the release announcement to a newsgroup&quot; or &quot;comb through the bug list for notable release notes&quot;.<br /><br />In those places, just make it as easy as possible for a human to do it.  For example, when I&#39;m looking for release notes, I wrote a script that extracts changesets and groups them by bug number, dumps that into a text file and then shows me an xterm with the summary, and another window where I can type in my release notes.<br /><br />Not automated, but *easy*.</div>

Documenting your code is <i>not</i>&nbsp;important. Well-documented code is not a thing to be desired nor a goal to be sought. A lack of documentation is not a problem to be solved.

It might even be necessary for it. But do not confuse interface with implementation and do not confuse what you want with how to get it.<br /><br />Solve the problem of confusing, opaque code.

The bugs page for projects on Launchpad used to have a really ugly pie chart on them. It was a strange little graph, &nbsp;useful because it helped you feel like you were making progress as you pushed bugs from New to Triaged to In-progress to Fix Committed and then off the chart completely with Fix Released.<br /><br />Pie charts suck though. They use two dimensions to represent one dimension of data, and they are always 100% full. In the case of bugs, there was no way to tell from the pie chart whether there were more or fewer bugs than last week.<br /><br />Inspired by some sketches from mpt, I decided to implement what I think would be a nice graph to have on Launchpad, but to do so using the <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/API">webservice API</a>. I&#8217;ve put some code up on <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/everyday">lp:everyday</a>, and there&#8217;s <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jml/convergence/">an example of the graph for the whole Launchpad project</a>.<br /><br />The code works by sucking down all of the bug tasks associated with a project over the API, then storing them in a desktopcouch database, then using that to generate some timeline data. The graph is made using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">flot</a>, which is excellent.<br /><br />For those of you who care about Launchpad API details, I&#8217;ve recently added a parameter to <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/+apidoc/devel.html#bug_target">searchTasks</a></span> called <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">modified_since</span> that lets you <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/malone/+bug/590535">fetch only bug tasks for bugs that have changed since a particular date</a>. It makes syncing so much faster.</div>

Recently, I&#8217;ve been accused of cheating at Inbox Zero, since although I&#8217;ve got no email in my Inbox, I have twenty to thirty threads marked down as things that need reading or following-up on.<br /><br />To these accusations, I have only one thing to say: you&#8217;re doing it wrong.<br /><br />Inbox Zero is a method, not a creed. It&#8217;s not even very much of a goal. It&#8217;s a system that says:<br /><br /><ul><li>put all of your unprocessed <i>stuff</i> (in this case, email) in one place (your inbox),&nbsp;</li><li>go through that pile of stuff one at a time</li><li>make a decision about what you need to do about it (e.g., &#8220;nothing&#8221;, &#8220;reply&#8221;, &#8220;actually read it&#8221;)</li><li>record the results of that decision (put it in a folder; tag it)</li><li>remove the thing from the pile</li></ul><br />Or rather, it&#8217;s a succinct way of talking about how to apply GTD principles to email.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The &#8220;Zero&#8221; refers to the size of that pile of unprocessed stuff, not the number of things on your todo list.</div><br /><br />If you don&#8217;t have three hours spare to read GTD, you really ought to spend one hour watching <a href="http://inboxzero.com/video/">Merlin Mann&#8217;s video on Inbox Zero</a>.</div>

Good points JML.. I think the Inbox Zero philosophy is outdated!<br /><br />Expunging the Inbox is a ritual from the early days of mailbox quotas and fear of filling up /var. There&#39;s no need to free up space these days, and since email is instantly searchable (on Gmail at least), I argue that it makes no sense at all to delete from your Inbox, other than to keep your OCD at bay. <br /><br />It&#39;s easier these days to use Email like a &quot;stream&quot; - just like your Facebook or Twitter news feed. I currently have 16,000+ messages in my Inbox - all I care is that they are all &quot;read&quot;. I star items that I will come back to and that require further action. <br /><br />Making your Inbox Zero is a superflous action that really doesn&#39;t achieve anything!</div>

If you&#8217;ve never been to a UDS, you probably don&#8217;t know what an intense, inspiring, fun, draining time it can be.<div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I got back and started mucking around on my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS laptop on my home network. Everything was great until – suddenly – the wireless connection drops out. I have two other devices (Android, OS X) that are connected just fine, so I know it&#8217;s probably not a network configuration issue.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also have noticed this behaviour all the way through Karmic and since the Lucid beta.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to fix this bug. I want this to be my personal contribution to Maverick. I&#8217;m inspired, I&#8217;m <i>pumped</i>, but I don&#8217;t really know where to begin. I don&#8217;t even know how to file a good bug about this.</div><div><br /></div><div>That&#8217;s where I need your help.</div></div>

Maybe!<br /><br />That bug points to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=493018" rel="nofollow">Redhat bug 493018</a>, which claims to be recently fixed.</div>

Well, I&#39;ve got the relevant chunk of the syslog.<br />http://static.mumak.net/syslog-from-disconnect.log<br /><br />Dan, I&#39;d feel uncomfortable trying out a new version of the kernel without having a way of reproducing the bug or any understanding of what is actually causing it.<br /><br />Mary, at UDS I sat in rooms full of those people. They really are quite nice once you get to know them. I&#39;m hoping that with this bug, I can understand it deeply enough that the calls to retest won&#39;t seem as arbitrary.</div>

Just don&#39;t file the bug somewhere where those &quot;you haven&#39;t reconfirmed this bug in the last two seconds! please retest!&quot; people can get at it.</div>

I&#39;d begin by testing the latest mainline build at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.34-lucid/ (2.6.34 has a sufficiently more interesting WiFi stack). See also http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/Reporting_bugs (note that the kernel wiki pointing to Ubuntu doesn&#39;t really contain useful information if you&#39;re already testing 2.6.34 as recommended).</div>

First you need to debunk the Funcrapulators. Quickly, before the Unlogger kicks in and makes its way into the Codestand. You don&#39;t want the Leggings to fall off that one or you&#39;ll be <i>in</i>. In <i>real</i>. Real <i>trouble</i>.</div>

I have the same driver and the same problem, actually. I usually blame the binary blob firmware and go on my merry way.<br /><br />Let me know if you find a way to trigger it. Without a way to do that, I&#39;m really not clued enough to guess where it might be getting stuck.</div>

I&#39;ve got the same problem. I&#39;m in ;-)<br />For me this only happends with Atheros Chipsets. Especially the AR5001X. Compiling madwifi and blacklisting ath5k/9k only helps a little. I also tried ditching NetworkManager and using /etc/network/interfaces for configuration. That didn&#39;t help either (wireless performance/stability still way below jaunty).<br /><br />That leaves me with the conclusion that this a kernel issue. The exact same drivers (madwifi) work nicely in jaunty.</div>

Reloading the driver (rmmod iwlagn; modprobe iwlagn) works.<br /><br />Will check in syslog next time it happens.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

Blogger claims you posted this almost 7 hours from now. Is it perhaps set to show timestamps in Tasmanian time?<br /><br />Anyways, first step is to identify the culprit: you could try looking through syslog to see if the driver&#39;s making a fuss about anything, if NetworkManager got fed up, dhclient not getting enough love, etc. <br /><br />Does restarting NetworkManager help anything? (sudo restart network-manager)<br /><br />Does reloading the driver help?</div>

<a href="http://weloveastrid.com/">I love Astrid</a>, and have really enjoyed getting the four hundred tasks I have into it and synced with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>. I almost love <a href="http://gtg.fritalk.com/">Getting Things GNOME</a>, and thought I&#8217;d experiment a bit getting my tasks synced from RTM on to my desktop using GTG.<div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately, I ballsed something up, and now all of my four hundred tasks from RTM have been deleted. Sad. They are all still on Astrid though. Happy. But when I sync from Astrid to Remember the Milk, none of those four hundred tasks are uploaded. Sad.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you know how I can get my tasks back on to RTM, can you please comment here, or on the <a href="https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/astrid/+question/110188">question I asked on Launchpad</a>.</div></div>

It sounds like GTG ballsed something up.  Whatever it was that made you delete all of your work should probably be reported as a a bug :).<br /><br />I am reminded of <a href="http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html" rel="nofollow">Havoc Pennington&#39;s screed on the subject</a>.  Get them to fix whatever in the UI did not put a GIANT molly-guard over this feature :).</div>
