So, I think I&#8217;ve figured out what it is I dislike about Twisted&#8217;s review process: reviews aren&#8217;t thorough enough.<br /><br />This sounds a little weird, since it&#8217;s actually <span style="font-style: italic;">really hard</span> to get a patch into Twisted: it almost always takes me at least three round trips just to get something in. But I think the number of round-trips is actually a symptom of this lack of completeness.<br /><br />In Launchpad, reviews are done as in-line replies to diffs. A reviewer is obliged to note each chunk of code that needs to be changed, along with exactly what needs to be changed. In Twisted, reviews are done as Trac comments and generally provided as bullet points. In Launchpad, a reviewer would say, &#8220;You need to change foo_bar to fooBar, because our coding standards require camel case&#8221;. In Twisted, a reviewer might say &#8220;There are some naming convention issues&#8221;.<br /><br />This obviously varies between reviewers and even between reviews, but I think that the difference in technologies encourages differences in review style.<br /><br />As a patch submitter, I find the in-line-comments-on-diff form much more helpful. It provides me with a convenient todo list, and it lets me know that the reviewer has looked through and tried to understand all of my code. It essentially turns the review into a series of mini bug reports with &#8220;observed, expected, how to reproduce&#8221; sections (where &#8220;how to reproduce&#8221; is &#8220;where to find&#8221;).<br /><br />I also like it as a reviewer, since it means less typing.</div>

So, glyph, vague comments do have *something* to do with the tools, because with some technologies it&#39;s easier to be specific. Email quoted reply, for example.<BR/><BR/>I don&#39;t have anything as good as &quot;jump to an FQPN&quot;. I do have etags though, which is generally good enough.<BR/><BR/>My own toolchain for navigating big emails could probably be better. At the moment I use Gmail&#39;s &quot;collapse quoted text&quot; feature and that solves most of my problems.<BR/><BR/>The other big advantage of email (which you could get from other tools, I guess) is that as the *reviewer* I can easily see which of my points the author has replied to, and more importantly, which points they haven&#39;t.<BR/><BR/>Other points worth mentioning is that Launchpad tries to keep diff size down (you need to specially arrange a reviewer if your diff is &gt; 800 lines). This probably has an impact on tool experience.<BR/><BR/>I agree that something higher level would be much better. Perhaps we can con Barry into writing such an emacs mode?</div>

I think that most of what glyph wants could probably be done with a sufficiently advanced major mode for Launchpad style review-amongst-quoted-diffs.  Not that I&#8217;m going to write this any time soon.<BR/><BR/>One of the problems with the fancy web-based solutions &#8211; have glyph or jml tried any of them?  I haven&#8217;t &#8211; is that you can&#8217;t use emacs, of course.<BR/><BR/>I also don&#8217;t have <I>all</I> that much experience with Twisted&#8217;s development process yet &#8211; hopefully that will change soon :)</div>

There were a few things that I realize were implicit in my last comment.  For one thing, I didn&#8217;t make it clear how much I agree with the experience you&#8217;re espousing.  I always copy review comments into an outline buffer and delete each point as I deal with it, using it as a nice to-do list with a built in progress meter.  I actually find that emailed diffs make this much harder to do.<BR/><BR/>I also offered no specific criticism of the suckage of email and diffs.<BR/><BR/>I find scrolling around hundreds of lines of un-annotated context difficult, and (without reconfiguring my editor to use extremely loud font faces) I find it easy to miss individual points, and I spend a lot more time reading code that I wrote.  I also find it very easy to get a hunk of diff and have no idea what chunk of code it refers to without scrolling around.  Even without my aforementioned elisp, I find it a lot easier to manually translate the string &#8220;twisted.web.server.Request.render&#8221; into some file/line pair in my editor than &#8220;@@ -187,7 +187,7 @@&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Maybe this is because I prefer to work through reviews in issue order, not in file order; i.e. if there&#8217;s a problem with the structure of some API, I will fix issues with the tests and the code at the same time.</div>

I may have made my argument too strongly.<BR/><BR/>I can definitely see some advantages to using email.  Having dealt with a couple of your reviews written in this style now, I can appreciate its subjective impact, at least a little.  Personally I find it a wash with the way that I&#8217;m doing things now.  <BR/><BR/>Your comment about feedback like &#8220;there are some coding standard issues&#8221; is well-taken.  This is a pretty crappy form of comment, and we should try to keep that in mind ourselves and also educate other reviewers about what constitutes a good comment.  I don&#8217;t think this actually has anything to do with the tools, because I&#8217;ve gotten (and written) lots of reviews that don&#8217;t make that mistake.<BR/><BR/>My favorite kind of review is where everything is phrased in terms of FQPNs; there is a button in my editor which can (sort of) take me directly to the definition of an FQPN, so it&#8217;s a very quick copy/paste.<BR/><BR/>My main point, though, is that these are both rough approximations of what we actually want.  You don&#8217;t want to type into the middle of a hunk of diff; I don&#8217;t want to copy and paste an FQPN into some bespoke secret elisp.  We both want to abstractly indicate a region of changed code and annotate it during the review process, then send those annotations back to the author in a format where they can easily see them.<BR/><BR/>I can see how emailing commentary on diffs more closely approximates this ideal for you.  For me, it does not, and I prefer ticket comments with module names in them.  But let&#8217;s not lose sight of the fact that both experiences are terrible next to being able to push a button in your editor and see the next feedback comment you have to deal with, right next to the code that the feedback is on.<BR/><BR/>If you have a mechanism to jump directly to a region of code in emacs based on a mangled / email-quoted diff, though, I&#8217;d be very interested :).</div>

glyph, certainly the diff format has a lot of problems and using something richer that could provide more context would be better.<BR/><BR/>But regarding cramming &#8220;the immense suckage of email into the already sucky world of code review&#8221;, I think you&#8217;d be surprised. By and large, we find doing reviews email <I>less</I> sucky.<BR/><BR/>Part of the reason is that you get a diff and a cover letter in your inbox, you type your recommended changes next to the code that causes them, then push a button that sends a review. It really is quite close to what you describe in paragraph 3.<BR/><BR/>I think that using numbers rather than bullets is definitely an improvement, but you get essentially that for free with email quoting.<BR/><BR/>If you can, you should contrive a way to experiment with doing reviews by email.<BR/><BR/>Also, fwiw, I&#8217;m not sure this is a Canonical-wide thing. I think Landscape uses a system much more like Twisted&#8217;s, for example.</div>

I feel like these are all kind of sad little workarounds for what I believe we all really want.<BR/><BR/>When I&#8217;m going to review a branch, I want to get a side-by-side diff view <I>where I actually write code</I>, i.e. Emacs, that looks something like Meld.  I want to have the merged code in my working copy so that I can run unit tests locally.  Ideally, I&#8217;d like to have that same UI for transparently running the code on the buildbots as well, but we&#8217;re getting pretty far afield into fantasy at that point&#8230;<BR/><BR/>I want to be able to annotate the changes by indicating them directly and typing them next to the changed region of code.  Then, when I&#8217;m done writing comments&#8230; I just want to push a button and send the review!  I don&#8217;t want to screw around with my mail client, push buttons on a web page, or anything like that.<BR/><BR/>Guido&#8217;s code review stuff (is codereview.appspot.com the same as Rietveld?) and reviewboard both kinda-sorta get this done, but with a god-awful amount of mousing around.  The &#8220;Show 10 Above / Show 10 Below&#8221; thing on codereview.appspot.com is a hilarious example of how bad this gets.  I don&#8217;t want to see &#8220;10 more lines&#8221; of diff, I want to know what goddamn class definition this method is a part of!<BR/><BR/>Anything that involves chopping up unstructured unified-diff content and reading it or writing about it is sucky.  Anything that separates the code from the diff from the ticket from the review is sucky.  I can definitely see the advantages of doing things the Canonical way, but I can also see the immense disadvantages of trying to cram the immense suckage of email into the already sucky world of code review.<BR/><BR/>Personally an emerging feature I like about Twisted&#8217;s review process is that reviewers are starting to use enumerated lists rather than bullet points, so it&#8217;s easy to refer to a point in subsequent comments and re-reviews.  But, in the system I&#8217;d really like to be using, that would all be automatic.</div>

I agree, and I hope that as the review facilities in LP evolve, we&#8217;ll grow something that leads users in this direction. One of the things I really like about Launchpad is the (implicit, but nevertheless very clear) approach of building an opinionated tool, a there-is-only-one-way-to-do-it tool. Once we&#8217;ve identified a process that works very well we should make Launchpad support this process and no other. I don&#8217;t know if Rietveld is the answer, but I hope that eventually we&#8217;ll have some kind of rich review tool that helps you do the right thing.</div>

You might be interested in Guido van Rossum&#8217;s Rietveld. [1] You just add the URL of your SVN repo, submit a patch, and tada: inline comment reviews. We&#8217;ve been using quite happily with core Python dev. The only annoying thing is posting your patch to the bug tracker and Rietveld, but that could be negated with Trac integration.<BR/><BR/>[1] http://codereview.appspot.com</div>
