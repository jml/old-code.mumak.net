Last week the Launchpad team leads gathered in London and had an absolutely huge meeting. Fifteen or sixteen smart, opinionated &amp; passionate people in a room talking about the next six months of Launchpad development. It was a lot of fun.<br /><br />When planning the agenda, Martin Albisetti and I were a little worried about things wandering off track, so we thrashed out a lists of dos &amp; don&#8217;ts. I&#8217;ll blurt them out here, with the really terrible ideas filtered out so I look more clever, and then offer some thoughts on how they worked.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do</span><br /><ul><li>be happy with the results of this meeting.</li><li>ask questions, especially &#8220;why&#8221;</li><li>be punctual</li><li>stay on point</li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don&#8217;t<br /></span><ul><li>design features</li><li>check your email, i.e. laptops closed<br /></li><li>leave the meeting without being clear</li><li>leave the meeting without being happy</li></ul>The &#8220;laptops closed&#8221; one didn&#8217;t work so well. It was great for the first couple of days, but by Thursday afternoon there were always people in a corner with those open LCD screens sucking chi out of the room like little dragons of despair.<br /><br />The &#8220;Don&#8217;t design features&#8221; rule was awesome. The rationale is that feature design leads to long discussions, and that it does a disservice to the many excellent engineers we have who aren&#8217;t at the meeting and will be actually implementing a feature. At best, it&#8217;s waste and at worst it&#8217;s us telling people how to do something that they know how to do better. The clearest sign that it was a good idea came when other people started using it to shut me up.</div>

FWIW, we deliberately scheduled an hour of &quot;unstructured&quot; time into each day.<br /><br />Mary, although I can&#39;t speak for the others, you describe exactly how I&#39;ve felt at these things in the past, and yes, it is draining. Although I can&#39;t think of any right now, perhaps there are more considerate ways of handling this than opening up your laptop.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I also had my laptop open inappropriately at some points of the meeting, and bear absolutely no ill will towards anyone there who did the same.</div>

Re email checking, I don&#39;t know exactly how you set it up, but maybe there&#39;s an introversion problem with these sprint meetings.<br /><br />You get a bunch of people, many of whom (I think) work from home. They&#39;ve travelled, they might be sharing a hotel room, they&#39;re spending all day having high stakes, high bandwidth face-to-face interactions. They socialise all evening. They sleep. They go round again. It may be pretty draining especially compared to their usual quota of human interaction.<br /><br />So it may be that some of them are trying to create some downtime for themselves by laptopping. I don&#39;t have a good solution given the expense of these meetings.</div>

I wonder what to do about the &quot;laptops not closed&quot; problem.  I guess the solution depends on the cause&#8230;<br /><br /><i>Email genuinely backing up and needs to be dealt with?</i>  That certainly sounds plausible after several days.  Allocate some time for catching up on demands from the outside world.<br /><br /><i>Meeting fatigue â€” after several days of intense discussion perhaps some people&#39;s capacity for engaging in intense discussion is simply exhausted?</i>  Not sure what to do about this except for taking more time or doing less, neither of which is satisfactory.  Or finding a way when planning the week to accomodate the inevitable reduced energy towards the end, e.g. shorter sessions and more breaks?<br /><br /><i>Some participants don&#39;t think the current topic is very relevant to them, or that their involvement is superfluous?</i>  There&#39;s a pretty important disconnect there&#8230; why did they attend in the first place, and why were they invited?  If circumstances have changed since the meeting attendees were chosen then maybe there needs to be a way for people to gracefully uninvite themselves.<br /><br />Put another way, if someone&#39;s laptop is not closed, why don&#39;t they just excuse themselves and leave the room entirely?  Perhaps there&#39;s no just obvious way to do that politely.  Or perhaps they feel obliged to be there, but simultaneously don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s a good use of their time (maybe just because they have meeting fatigue).  That&#39;s a pretty serious problem, and definitely a vibe-sucking one, and I&#39;d love to know a good solution.<br /><br />Maybe next time quietly approach a culprit during a break and ask them as non-judgementally as possible why they&#39;ve started opening their laptop during a meeting?</div>
