Hello, my name is Jonathan Lange, and this is my technical blog.

On this blog, you'll find discussion about [Python](http://www.python.org),
unit testing, programming in general, vague sorts of ramblings about process,
attempts at figuring out better ways of doing things, announcements of
releases of software, and probably some other things.

I also have a [non-technical blog](http://life.mumak.net), which you might
find interesting.

Unless otherwise stated, all code snippets on this blog are available under
the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

I work for Google, but all of the posts I share here represent my views and
not theirs.
