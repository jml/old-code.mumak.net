Hello <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools">testtools</a> fans.<br /><br />If you are wondering what all the recent bug mail was about, wonder no more, for I shall explain. Thus.<br /><br />We're using only three different levels of importance for testtools bugs: Critical, Medium and Wishlist. Critical is reserved for release blockers: regressions, test failures and other disasters. Medium is for genuine defects and other things that we think are important. Wishlist is for everything else. I think of them as Critical, Important and Someday.<br /><br />All of this is in preparation for the 0.9.8 release, which promises to be a doozy. &nbsp;Stay tuned.</div>
