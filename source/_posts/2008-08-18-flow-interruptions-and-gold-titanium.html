As I mentioned earlier, I've just had a very productive and fun weekend of hacking on <a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a>. But why was it so good?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Commits</span><br /><br />Because I was working offline using Bazaar, I could make commits to testresources and they'd be done before I could Alt-Tab back to Emacs.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Tests</span><br /><br />It takes about 0.15 seconds to run the test suite. This meant I was running it all the time, which in turn meant that I was totally certain about whether the code worked all the time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clarity of Purpose</span><br /><br />I knew where I was and where I wanted to go.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Rabbit Holes</span><br /><br />The testresources code base is small enough that it is nearly impossible to get distracted by <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span> systemic defects. If there is such a defect, it's probably the one that you're working on right now. This might be another way of saying...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Blockers</span><br /><br />I wasn't waiting on anyone to do anything. There weren't any other bugs that needed to get fixed before I could continue.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Integration</span><br /><br />The system is about as self-contained as it gets. No signals, subprocesses or sockets: just Python. The only dependency is pyunit3k, which is small, robust, well-tested and also pretty darn self-contained.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Interruptions</span><br /><br />I wasn't answering questions on IRC, taking Skype calls, handling incoming email, doing the washing, checking Facebook, catching up on my blogs, watching a film or wrestling a bear. "Fast Commits" and "Fast Tests" probably fall into this category too.<br /><br />In other words:<br /><blockquote>There is nothing except this. There's no art opening, no charity, nothing to sign. There's the next mission, and nothing else.  </blockquote></div>

If you let me know next time you're doing this sort of thing, I can provide some interruptions by calling you on your cell, if you think that would make you feel at home.</div>
