It's way too hard to keep all of my music stored on one machine in a lossless format, have it backed up to another machine, synced to my iPod in MP3 and have it pleasingly playable on my OS X computer. Way too hard. Really.<br />Especially since fixes to track listings and so forth seem to vanish like smoke in the breeze. Banshee and Rhythmbox both pretend to help, but that's only so they can mess with my life more.</div>

I hear you.  3 desktop/laptops (home/work), a media server, my phone, ... I&#39;m slowly working on my music app that will try to manage this for me.  Any feature requests?</div>
