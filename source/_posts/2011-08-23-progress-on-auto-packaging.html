<div class='post'>
Instead of a junk branch, the auto packaging code now has <a href="https://launchpad.net/pkgme-binary">a proper home on Launchpad</a>. I've filed bugs for all of the things that I could think of that were wrong with it. Actually, that's a lie. When I spot something wrong in code or behaviour I make a note, usually a XXX comment. The bugs up there are the ones I got from grepping my notes.<br /><br />Anyway, minor rant on effective use of brain and the gift of literacy aside, I've also done a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomagicBinaryPackaging">reasonably detailed specification</a>. It's been a long time since I've done a spec this technical &amp; detailed, but I hope it works out.&nbsp;If you have any comments or questions, ask here or on the spec itself.</div>
