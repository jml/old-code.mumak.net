Does Sydney have a Super Happy Dev House or Hacking Society or <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> where a bunch of busy programmers can sit down together and <span style="font-style: italic;">hack</span>?<br /><br />If not, could you please organize one for me â€” that'd be great.</div>

You should organize one yourself! I'd be more than happy to talk about the logistics of setting up a DevHouse. (You can email me at first @ lastname .com)</div>

There's a "Codecon" that happens once a year, although it's really coding + camping.  The most recent was <A HREF="http://slug.org.au/node/104" REL="nofollow">http://slug.org.au/node/104</A>.<BR/><BR/>I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.</div>

We can set up a Sydney Hacking Society chapter if you'd like.  You'd have to do the actual organizing though.  :)</div>
