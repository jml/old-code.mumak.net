I've been on a bit of a sanity bender recently: science, logic, evidence, experimentation, clarity and things like that. Here's a short list of some of the things I've been reading:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>&nbsp;(H/T mwhudson)</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Crooked-Thinking-Robert-Thouless/dp/1444117181">Straight and Crooked Thinking</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pretotyping.org/">Pretotype It</a>&nbsp;(H/T lifeless)</li><li><a href="http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html">Lost Tools of Learning</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Dangerous-Half-Truths-Total-Nonsense/dp/1591398622/">Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total-Nonsense</a>&nbsp;(H/T lifeless)</li><li><a href="http://glinden.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/puzzling-outcomes-in-ab-testing.html">Puzzling outcomes in A/B testing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a></li></ul><br />If you're writing software then I recommend "Pretotype It" first, because it's likely to make you write <i>less</i>&nbsp;software, and that can only be a good thing. They are all great reads though.<br /><br />There are a few general themes: be explicit about your assumptions and try to verify or falsify them as soon as you may; do experiments; beware of certain mistakes or logical short-cuts; learn statistics; understand what you are saying.&nbsp;Wonderful notions all, but I'm not sure whether they are working out for me.<br /><br />Occasionally I'll get an email that has a couple of sentences but somehow manages to squeeze in all sorts of conflations, non sequiturs, and general fudging. It's hard to know where to begin. I can make a fair stab at analyzing the errors, but synthesizing a response that actually <i>helps</i>&nbsp;is very hard.<br /><br />Rigour also puts a restraint on rhetoric. It's hard to say something convincingly when you have a bunch of qualifiers dangling at the end. My writing (even now!) is slowed down as I notice the unfounded assertions and unstated assumptions that lie behind it.<br /><br />Also, much of this doesn't help you get from a vague, interesting intuition to a workable idea, from hunch to hypothesis, if you will. Sometimes a notion needs to time to grow before it's rejected as irrational or incorrect. Something like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats">Thinking Hats</a>&nbsp;can help here.<br /><br />This is all peanuts though. Do more science. Really.</div>

I find that, when confronted with a muddled mess of ideas in email, friendly, direct communication is best.  Especially because people will almost always surprise you with their capacity to improve their communications, and you&#39;ll rarely have to write a &quot;these are the twenty-seven logical fallacies that you have committed in this message&quot; kind of message twice.<br /><br />It can take some practice to make this kind of communique not come off as super condescending, but it&#39;s definitely doable.  The trick is to keep the focus on the communication and not the person or the ideas.</div>

I just finished Pretotyping; that was an interesting and useful read. Thanks for the suggestion.</div>
