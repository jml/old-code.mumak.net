<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools">testtools</a>'s sister project, <a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">subunit</a>,&nbsp;was using a&nbsp;private API that we deleted in the 0.9.13 release. &nbsp;This release restores&nbsp;that API in order to smooth out the upgrade path.<br /><br />If you don't use subunit, then this release won't matter very much to you.<br /><div><br /></div></div>
