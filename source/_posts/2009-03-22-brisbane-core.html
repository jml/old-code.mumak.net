Up in Brisbane, while I was diligently working away on package branches in Launchpad, many of the Bazaar guys were working on their new "brisbane-core" format.<br /><br />I overheard one of them say in this new format 'log -v' is up to twenty times faster.<br /><br />Want more details? Well, perhaps someone else on Planet Bazaar can provide them.</div>
