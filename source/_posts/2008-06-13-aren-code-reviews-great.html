Ben Sussman-Collins writes about <a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=96">programmer insecurity</a> and how a lot of programmers dread having others see their code.<br /><br />Some of the <a href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com">best</a> <a href="http://robertcollins.net">programmers</a> <a href="http://radix.twistedmatrix.com">I've</a> <a href="http://sourcefrog.net">worked</a> <a href="http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com">with</a> <a href="http://python.net/crew/mwh/">are</a> in love with code reviews, and all great writers have editors. (The "linked list" is in no way exhaustive.)  Personally, I see reviews as being a great opportunity to learn.<br /><br />Sussman-Collins also writes about how distributed version control can exacerbate the "isolated genius" problem by shielding ones code from the public eye. This is definitely a big potential drawback of DVCS, but one that's largely mitigated by a culture of short-lived branches and <a href="https://code.launchpad.net">an easy-to-use public registry of all branches for a project</a>.</div>
