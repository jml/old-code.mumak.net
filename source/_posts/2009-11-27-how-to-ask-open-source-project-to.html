This isn't exhaustive, but I think there are two ways to ask an open source project to do something:<div><ol><li>I want X. You should do X.</li><li>I want X. How can I help do X?</li></ol></div><div>I have no data, but I think that asking the second way is what makes open source actually work.</div></div>
