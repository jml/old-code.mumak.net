Those who closely follow <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools">testtools</a> development will notice something unusual in the 0.9.28 release: we now <a href="https://github.com/testing-cabal/testtools/">host the code on Github</a> rather than <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools/">on Launchpad</a>.<br /><br />There are a few reasons behind the switch, but the biggest one is that the ecosystem of tools and services around Git &amp; Github is much, much larger than that around Launchpad &amp; Bazaar. &nbsp;Already, by using Travis (thanks <a href="https://github.com/kampka/">kampka</a>!), I've been able to kill off an old, cruddy, insecure Jenkins installation on my server, and actually get proper testing across all of the Python versions that testtools supports. &nbsp;No more, "oops, I broke 3.2" again.<br /><br />We still <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/testtools/+bugs">track our bugs on Launchpad</a>, because Launchpad's bug tracker is still our favourite.<br /><br />Happy hacking!<br /><br /></div>
