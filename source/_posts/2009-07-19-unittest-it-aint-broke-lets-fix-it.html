I spoke at <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2009</a> in Birmingham about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> module in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/index.html">Python standard library</a>.<br /><br />The central thesis was first proposed to me by Robert Collins, probably around 2003 or 2004. The idea is that unittest is actually surprisingly good and more extensible than you think. It was also Rob's idea to co-present this as a talk in Birmingham. Sadly, I was obliged to present it by myself.<br /><br />I'd like to write up the talk more thoroughly, and am keen to publish brief posts on why layers are bad and why setUpClass is bad, but for now I'll just post the artifacts from EuroPython.<br /><ul><li>Slides (<a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/EuroPython-2009-unittest-jml.odp">ODP</a> | <a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/EuroPython-2009-unittest-jml.pdf">PDF</a>)<br /></li><li><a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/unittest-lets-fix-it-slides.txt">Text version of slides</a></li><li><a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/unittest-lets-fix-it.txt">Notes</a></li><li><a href="http://static.mumak.net/Jonathan_Lange-Unittest_It_aint_broke_lets_fix_it.ogg">Audio</a> (<a href="http://wiki.europython.eu/RecordedTalks?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Jonathan_Lange-Unittest_It_aint_broke_lets_fix_it.ogg">mirror</a>)<br /></li></ul>What do you think?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: Audio now available.</div>

I agree. As I mentioned in the original post, I would love to turn this into a paper.</div>

I think we need something that glues together slides and audio. Now, they do not interact and it is not fun to follow this presentation that seems very valuable.<br /><br />What presentation gurus say is that the handout is different document from the speech and different from the slides also. It is a third document which needs its own hours of design and tuning.</div>
