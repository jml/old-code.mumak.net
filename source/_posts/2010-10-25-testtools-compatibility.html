<div class='post'>
We've recently been getting a few bugs filed on <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools">testtools</a> about compatibility with various versions of Python. I really want to support as many versions as I can, but I simply don't have them on my system.<br /><br />What resources are available to me if I want to set up a Hudson instance or similar that runs testtools tests against Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1? A Windows run would also be nice.</div>

You&#39;d definitely benefit from asking that question directly to Holger.<br /><br />I think you basically need to throw tox (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox) at the problem and see if it sticks though.</div>
