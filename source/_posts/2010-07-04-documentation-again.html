Documenting your code is <i>not</i>&nbsp;important. Well-documented code is not a thing to be desired nor a goal to be sought. A lack of documentation is not a problem to be solved. Everyone who tells you otherwise is lying.<br /><br />What <i>is</i> important is that other programmers can easily understand your code and the intent behind it, and that <i>you</i>&nbsp;can understand the code and the intent six months later.<br /><br />Documenting your code is merely a way of achieving that. It might even be necessary for it. But do not confuse interface with implementation and do not confuse what you want with how to get it.<br /><br />Solve the problem of confusing, opaque code. Aim for code that can be easily understood. Document if necessary.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">(it's pretty much always necessary)</span></div>
