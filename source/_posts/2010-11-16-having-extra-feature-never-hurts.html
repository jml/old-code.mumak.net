On the Launchpad user list, we're having a bit of a chat about whether <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/launchpad-users/msg06098.html">or not to remove team polls</a>. &nbsp;One commenter suggested that "having an extra feature never hurts". <a href="http://curtis.hovey.name/">Curtis</a>'s <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/launchpad-users/msg06110.html">reply</a> is so good I want to quote it here in full:<br /><blockquote><pre>Actually, It always hurts. It is always bad:<br /><br />     1. The bad UI experience reflects poorly on all Launchpad.<br />     2. A user tried to mess with URLs to avoid the UI and caused an<br />        oops. I spent a couple days fixing an issue that I personally do<br />        not think should ever have been a priority. Certainly there are<br />        at least a 1000 more important bugs than the oops, but we<br />        believe oopses are always high priority.<br />     3. Pages are slower to load because the application looks for poll<br />        data.<br />     4. We must update the code as libraries and infrastructure changes.<br />     5. We need to triage and retriage all the poll bugs.<br />     6. We need to answer user questions on Lp Answers and IRC.<br /><br />It is better that Launchpad provides 5 really great features than to<br />provide 10 mediocre features. I prefer to remove the feature, but if the<br />community believes that it is important, we might work on this in the<br />upcoming Launchpad bugjam to close as many bugs as possible in a week. I<br />cannot foresee this feature being compelling in the net two years<br />without a contributor dedicating time to it.<br /><br />The situation is eloquently stated by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry<br /><br />        A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is<br />        nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take<br />        away.</pre></blockquote>&nbsp;That is all.</div>
