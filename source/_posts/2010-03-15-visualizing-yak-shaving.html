Over the weekend I read <a href="http://carymillsap.blogspot.com/">Cary Millsap</a>'s excellent paper <a href="http://method-r.com/downloads/doc_details/44-thinking-clearly-about-performance"><i>Thinking Clearly About Performance</i></a>. In it, he hijacks the <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/sequenceDiagram.htm">UML Sequence Diagram</a> format by drawing the vertical axis to scale. The bigger the gap between lines, the more time was taken performing that interaction. Suddenly, the sequence diagram can give you a clear picture of where time is being spent.<div><br /></div><div>Wouldn't this be a useful diagram to draw instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping">value-stream maps</a>? You would lose the easy distinction between "value generating" and "waste" steps, but I think you'd gain a deeper understanding of hand-offs and of system complexity. Drawing it to scale would give a helpful picture of where time is being spent, and where response time can be improved. </div><div><br /></div><div>More generally, Lean folk should probably read Millsap's paper and think hard about what it means for software engineering process.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, I reckon drawing up a quick sequence diagram would be a great way of seeing how deep one is in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak-shaving</a>. Each time you go one layer deeper, add a new column and draw a new arrow and make a note of when &amp; why.</div></div>

In my experience, it would be realized as a stack with the most recent problem to solve topmost.</div>

&gt; I reckon drawing up a quick sequence diagram would be a great way of seeing how deep one is in yak-shaving. Each time you go one layer deeper, add a new column and draw a new arrow and make a note of when &amp; why.<br /><br />I love this idea.  I&#39;m going to try it out.  I&#39;m deep enough in my current projects (both at work and at home) that this will be a non-trivial diagram.<br /><br />If it provides any useful information, I may share this with my team as well.  Thanks!</div>
