<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/">Matt Zimmerman</a> writes about whether we should&nbsp;<a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2011/03/07/listening-to-users/">listen to users</a>. It's a great post, and you should read it, but the summary is:<br /><br /><ol><li>If you want inspiration for a new product, don't listen to users, watch them</li><li>To test whether a product is a good fit, ask users for feedback and listen to it</li><li>If you want to incrementally improve an existing offering, don't listen, gather data</li></ol><br />I'm over-simplifying, you should read the original post. I also wonder whether it should be "when is it safe to not act on user feedback", rather than "not listening" per se.</div>
