I would be much more sympathetic to the whole Python 3 endeavour if they had made a serious effort to keep the major 2.x releases mutually compatible.</div>

Python 2.7 breaks a fair bit of code vs 2.6. At least for a significant code base. And 2.6 did the same vs 2.5 before that.<br /><br />In experience, it <i>is</i> possible to write code that can run on 2.4-2.6(7) at the same time. But it almost never works that way from the start.</div>
