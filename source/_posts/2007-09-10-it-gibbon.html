<div class='post'>
Over the weekend I upgraded my laptop to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu 7.10</a> aka "The Gutsy Gibbon".<br /><br />Obvious improvements include having Pidgin installed and a much superior version of Deskbar. There's also a swanky new panel to actually control display settings (dual monitor and all that jazz). Unfortunately, I can't quite get it to work just yet. My 22" 1680x1058 LCD will just have to sit there, gathering dust :(<br /><br />In another weirdness, all of my fonts are suddenly much, much bigger. I had to resize everything down to 8 or 9 to make them sane.<br /><br />My <a href="http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/">pretty Emacs</a> has also stopped working, but that's to be expected. It's a third-party package that hasn't yet been built for Gutsy.<br /><br />Other than that, seems to be a fairly routine upgrade. Is there anything exciting that I've missed?</div>
