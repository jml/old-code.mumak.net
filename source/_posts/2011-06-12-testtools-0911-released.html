While I slept, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a> released <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools/0.9.11">testtools 0.9.11</a>. This release is mostly a bug fix release, but the fixes are very much worthwhile.<br /><br />In particular, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gz">Martin [gz]</a> got our Python 3 support going again, <a href="http://gavinpanella.com/">Gavin Panella</a> fixed up a dodgy Matcher and fixed a bug in how we feed information from fixtures into test results.<br /><br />Also in this release, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~tcole">Tim Cole</a> and <a href="http://sourcefrog.net/">Martin Pool</a> made their first ever patches, for which they have my hearty thanks and congratulations. (The congratulations are also hearty.)<br /><br />As always, it's just so darn <i>pleasant</i>&nbsp;to see so many fine people working together to make an open source project work.</div>
