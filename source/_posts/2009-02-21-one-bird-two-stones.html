<a href="http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/">Glyph</a> thinks that <a href="http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/02/explaining-why-interfaces-are-great.html">interfaces are great</a>, and he is right (although I haven't read the full post, I certainly agree with the title).<br /><br />One of the natural things you can do with interfaces is this: make a new class Bar that delegates all of the properties of IFoo to an instance of class Foo. This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator pattern</a> (not to be confused with Python's decorator syntax), and is also the Bird in this parable.<br /><br />We use interfaces a lot in Launchpad, and we need to Decorate classes quite a bit. So, we wrote something to make it easy and open sourced it. It's called <a href="https://launchpad.net/lazr.delegates">lazr.delegates</a>. This is Stone One, if you like.<br /><br />Stone Two was actually cast first, and is called <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.components.html#proxyForInterface">twisted.python.components.proxyForInterface</a>. It's distributed as a part of Twisted, and solves exactly the same problem. For those interested, here's the <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Evcs-imports/twisted/main/annotate/head%3A/twisted/python/components.py">Twisted implementation</a> (scroll to line 320ish) and here's the <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad-pqm/lazr.delegates/devel/annotate/head%3A/src/lazr/delegates/__init__.py">lazr implementation</a>.<br /><br />Both implementations are fairly simple, and yet it is perhaps a shame that there are two of them. If anyone is at fault, it's me, since I knew about proxyForInterface and watched lazr.delegate arrive in the Launchpad tree without even thinking that the two might actually be the same thing.<br /><br />But I wonder, is there a process bug here? Is there something Launchpad, Twisted, Zope or Guido could have done to avoid this?</div>

I guess Twisted isn't the obvious place to look for interface utilities, or at least, it's not obvious to many people.<BR/><BR/>I guess you can relate this to the difficulty of spinning out useful things into separately distributed (maintained, released, installed, ...) packages.</div>
