<div class='post'>
A colleague recently asked the question, "Are single letter variable names evil?". He was trolling, and I kind of knew it, but gosh, what an excuse to rant about code clarity! My comments ended up being multiple pages long, so taking one of <a href="http://mary.gardiner.id.au/">Mary Gardiner</a>'s suggestions to heart (although I'm sure she regrets it now), I've turned it into a blog post.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I don't think single variable names are evil. Lots of the time they are a bad idea though.<br /><div><br /></div><div>The classic rule of thumb I've heard is that "the length of the variable name should be proportional to the log of the size of the scope". I can't find who said that originally. My <a href="http://www.jetcafe.org/jim/c-style.html">best guess is Mike Haertel</a>. It seems to be a good rule of thumb.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the corollary is that sometimes when the code is confusing, the problem isn't short variable names, it's that the scope is too large.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps there's also something to be said for shorter names being more useful for really generic code? I'm OK with an implementation of <code>map</code> taking either <code>f</code> and <code>xs</code> or <code>function</code> and <code>things</code>. I don't think either is better or worse.</div><div><br /></div><div>And maybe single letter variable names are acceptable when they are the standard terms for the problem domain. <code>(x, y)</code> might be clearer than <code>(horizontal_position, vertical_position)</code>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, Python's idiomatic filtering strongly encourages short names, because you have to repeat it three times within the scope of one expression:</div><div><br /></div><pre>[x for x in meaningfully_named_list_of_things if x.relevance &gt; THRESHOLD]</pre><div><br /></div><div>vs:</div><div><br /></div><pre>[meaningful_name&nbsp;</pre><pre> for meaningful_name in meaningfully_named_list_of_things&nbsp;</pre><pre> if meaningful_name.relevance &gt; THRESHOLD]</pre><div><br /></div><div>It's probably subjective, but I think the second one is less clear, since it obscures what's going on.﻿ Bice Dibley points out that in these list comprehensions, <code>x</code> functions much like a pronoun in English.</div><div><br /></div><div>As is the case when writing prose, being clear is hard. Rules can help – taking knowledge and distilling it into formal principles is one of the best ways for us to progress as a species! – but as Orwell said:</div><blockquote>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</blockquote><div>(And <a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/your-code-sucks.html">asking</a> <a href="http://blog.labix.org/2013/02/06/ethics-for-code-reviewers">someone</a> to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/code-reviews-just-do-it.html">look over</a> it soon will probably spare <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">troubles later</a>)</div></div>
