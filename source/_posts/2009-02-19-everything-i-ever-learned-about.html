... I learned from <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>.[1]<br /><br />Which reminds me, one of the Twisted guns is up for hire. His name is <a href="http://itamarst.org/resume.html">Itamar Shtull-Trauring</a> and he is very smart, wrote some of the best bits in Twisted and loses gracefully at <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/">Munchkin</a>.<br /><br />If you want someone in to review your system, help you design out a network protocol or provide a thoughtful, independent perspective for your new application's architecture, you should hire him. Itamar's got bad RSI, so he can't type much, otherwise I'd be trying to poach him.<br /><br />Note: Itamar still works for <a href="http://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA Software</a>, so it's only short-term contracting.<br /><br /><br />[1] Well, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> gets a guernsey too.</div>
