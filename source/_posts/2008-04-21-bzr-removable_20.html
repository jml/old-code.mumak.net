The plugin I talked about in a previous post is now at https://launchpad.net/bzr-removable. Please file bugs.<br /><br />Thanks to Michael Hudson and Daniel Watkins for submitting patches.<br /><br />You can get the plugin by typing 'bzr branch lp:bzr-removable' on the command line.</div>

The "Mary says" thing was a comment typed into the wrong field. Sorry again.</div>

Sure, I'm not laying down a fundamental law of physics here -- I'm describing my own personal motivation.<BR/><BR/>I'm sorry that your whole experience of this plugin has been terrible, and I'm glad you've gone to the trouble of posting here so that other googlers can find the docs you've written.<BR/><BR/>As this is obviously the first user feedback I've received, I would have liked to hear something nice, but perhaps there was nothing nice to say. <BR/><BR/>Mary says https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr-removable/+bug/322262</div>

Cause and effect on "bad documentation, unused software" is not always "unusued software leads to no motivation for documentation". I'd tend to argue the other way around, in fact.</div>

Thanks for the interest guys. I agree that the software is not well documented, but you are the first users I've heard from in the last eight months, I think the documentation is economical.<BR/><BR/>Can you please file bugs on the project on Launchpad?</div>

Fuller and more prominent documentation would be appreciated (in general my rule of thumb is that if I've had to go to a core developer of a piece of software for assistance, it's not well documented!)<BR/><BR/>The full sequence of install steps for this (on UNIX filesystems) is actually:<BR/><BR/>$ cd [some directory where one normally stores code]<BR/>$ bzr branch lp:bzr-removable<BR/>$ mkdir -p ~/.bazaar/plugins<BR/>$ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins<BR/>$ ln -s [some directory]/bzr-removable/removeable<BR/><BR/>Then "bzr plugins" will verify the install and finally the actual commands one needs are "bzr removable" and "bzr unremovable"</div>

Btw, more docs required.  You need to do something like:<BR/><BR/>bzr branch lp:bzr-removable ~/code/bzr-removable<BR/>ln -s ~/code/bzr-removable/removable ~/.bazaar/plugins/removable</div>
</div>
