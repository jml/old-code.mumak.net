<div class='post'>
There's a habit within Canonical on expressing agreement and disagreement numerically. If we agree with something someone says in email or IRC, we'll often say "+1", which means "I agree!" or "if we were to vote about this, you would have my vote". I sometimes hear people actually say the words "plus one" in conversation.<br /><br />Some have extrapolated from this to say "-1" to mean "I disagree", which is a pretty natural thing to do. However, it confuses me a lot.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">You see, the "+1" thing is a little bit like the&nbsp;<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dev/guidelines.html">Apache voting system</a>, which I met in my early days of open source, back when I lurked on the Subversion development mailing list. The voting rules there were burned into my mind, and I foolishly assume that they are equally fundamental to everyone else.</div><br /><br />In the Apache system, "-1" means "veto", which is a very strong way of disagreeing. When people on the Launchpad say "-1", I never really know what they mean. I don't blame them, "-1" is a bit of a silly way of vetoing a proposal. I bet if keyboards had a key for&nbsp;âˆž, there'd be a much more sensible way.<br /><br />I guess the moral of the story is, "ambiguous shorthand is ambiguous".<br /><br />Incidentally, how does the Apache voting system work out in practice these days?</div>

The numerical voting system is widely and currently used in the Python ecosystem.<br /><br />The meanings are (from [0]):<br /><br />    +1 I like it<br /><br />    +0 I don&#39;t care, but go ahead<br /><br />    -0 I don&#39;t care, so why bother?<br /><br />    -1 I hate it<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />[0] http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0010/</div>

My favourite vote is +1000, ie, &quot;OMG AWESOME YES YES YES&quot;. :)</div>

I don&#39;t have any experience of voting numerically outside of Canonical, but I have never considered -1 as a veto, except where unanimous consent is sought (but I can&#39;t remember being part of a vote like that). By that I mean that it has never even occurred to me! My assumption has always been that <i>agreement = sum(votes) &gt; 0</i>, with +0 and -0 being a non-influencing way to express inclination.</div>

For bzr, we always required no -1 votes, which lead to the -0 vote. (I&#39;m against this, but not enough to block it.)<br /><br />Of course, we also had the +0 (I think it is interesting, but not sure it should be accepted.), etc.<br /><br />Though we switched to words pretty quickly. I still really miss the &quot;BB:tweak&quot; vote. (Land it with some small changes.)</div>

A quick read through of the apache rules says -1 is a veto only if consensus is required. While we like consensus, we don&#39;t seem to require it on LP, if there&#39;s broad agreement and a few holdouts. So in that context, the -1 makes sense as disagreement.<br /><br />But largely, I agree with deryck; I&#39;ve seldom seen -1 used as veto in practice.</div>

Thing is, there are plenty of things that I disagree with but would not veto, even if I had the power.  Use of veto (or even saying &quot;I&#39;d veto this if I could&quot;) costs a certain amount of rhetorical capital.</div>

I think the ambiguity is because in practice no one uses -1 to mean veto.  -1 is just a vote against.  Whether or not you use it as veto is subject to the terms of your voting agreement. :-)  I&#39;ve only known Apache to use it as a veto.</div>
