My new shiny iMac 27" arrived today. It is very beautiful, although the screen is dauntingly large. When the <a href="http://kanexlive.com/products/item-id-3662.html">Kanex XD thingies</a> come out, I'll be able to plug my XBox into it too.<div><br /></div><div>It's the first time in a long time I've done a fresh install of a non-Ubuntu computer though. Some things, however, remain the same.</div><div><ol><li>Download decent browser (Firefox or Chrome)</li><li>Download IRC client (for OS X, Colloquy)</li><li>Generate SSH key</li><li>Upload SSH key to server, register it on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jml">Launchpad</a></li><li>Change the default Terminal settings to light grey text on a translucent black background</li><li>Get Emacs</li></ol><div>Oh, and to forestall questions, I'm not going to dual boot right now but I plan to eventually.</div></div></div>
