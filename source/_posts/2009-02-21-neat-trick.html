In Argentina I hacked up a little command for the 'launchpad' Bazaar plugin. It's a command line tool to open the Launchpad page for your branch in your web browser.<br /><pre>  $ cd ~/src/testresources/expose-reset-bug-271619<br /> $ bzr lp-open<br /> Opening https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~jml/testresources/expose-reset-bug-271619 in web browser<br /></pre>... and it works!<br /><br />Available in Bazaar 1.12. Due to an unfortunate oversight, the NEWS file doesn't mention it.</div>

There's a fix for the issues here in the Bazaar review queue: http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com.</div>

IIRC, public branch settings used only by `bzr send` command, and maybe by pqm plugin (I'm not sure).<BR/><BR/>Your command just unclear in what it ought to do and why for it designed. So...</div>

bialix, the main use case for this was to open the pages of branches that you already have locally. The command you type ought to work though.<BR/><BR/>Do you know why having public branches set is useful in general?</div>

$ bzr lp-open lp:qbzr<BR/><BR/>bzr: ERROR: There is no public branch set for "bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/qbzr/trunk/".<BR/><BR/>Your neat trick is a bit useless without public branch. Why I should have public branch for lp:qbzr branch anyway?</div>

Good point!<BR/><BR/>At the moment works based on the public location, which is different from the push location. I guess the push location could be used as a fallback.</div>

Don't seem to work with local branches pushed (with --remember) to launchpad. <BR/><BR/>$ bzr lp-open<BR/>bzr: ERROR: There is no public branch set for ...</div>
