<a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Elifeless">Rob</a> has landed my overhaul of <a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a>. testresources is now a lot cleaner, with more tests, more documentation and fewer classmethods. If you've looked at it before and found it a bit confusing, now is a great time to have a fresh look.<br /><br />The <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=news-20080828110236-ku9h8n676vfwcwad-1">NEWS</a> file, <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=README-20050904000703-ba3978635caa34f7">README</a> or <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk/annotate/18?file_id=todo-20080817122443-kaikqdedcg57lr4v-1">TODO</a> are all great places to start. Or, you could just download the <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Elifeless/testresources/trunk">branch</a> from Launchpad. 'bzr branch lp:testresources' should do the trick.<br /><br />There's still so much I want to do, but this has been the big step: getting a firm conceptual base to work from.</div>

I've published <A HREF="http://code.mumak.net/2008/10/testresources-some-examples.html" REL="nofollow">a howto with examples</A>. Tell me what you think.</div>

Yeah, that's a big thing I want to do. Unfortunately, the code I most want to do it with is proprietary!<BR/><BR/>I'll see what I can muster.</div>

Congratulations.  One thing that'd be useful to see is a demonstration test suite showing how to integrate all the bits.<BR/><BR/>It wasn't particularly obvious when I was trying to do so for a project and there wasn't easy to find other projects using the package.</div>
