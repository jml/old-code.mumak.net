Recently, I've been accused of cheating at Inbox Zero, since although I've got no email in my Inbox, I have twenty to thirty threads marked down as things that need reading or following-up on.<br /><br />To these accusations, I have only one thing to say: you're doing it wrong.<br /><br />Inbox Zero is a method, not a creed. It's not even very much of a goal. It's a system that says:<br /><br /><ul><li>put all of your unprocessed <i>stuff</i> (in this case, email) in one place (your inbox),&nbsp;</li><li>go through that pile of stuff one at a time</li><li>make a decision about what you need to do about it (e.g., "nothing", "reply", "actually read it")</li><li>record the results of that decision (put it in a folder; tag it)</li><li>remove the thing from the pile</li></ul><br />Or rather, it's a succinct way of talking about how to apply GTD principles to email.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The "Zero" refers to the size of that pile of unprocessed stuff, not the number of things on your todo list.</div><br /><br />If you don't have three hours spare to read GTD, you really ought to spend one hour watching <a href="http://inboxzero.com/video/">Merlin Mann's video on Inbox Zero</a>.</div>

Good points JML.. I think the Inbox Zero philosophy is outdated!<br /><br />Expunging the Inbox is a ritual from the early days of mailbox quotas and fear of filling up /var. There&#39;s no need to free up space these days, and since email is instantly searchable (on Gmail at least), I argue that it makes no sense at all to delete from your Inbox, other than to keep your OCD at bay. <br /><br />It&#39;s easier these days to use Email like a &quot;stream&quot; - just like your Facebook or Twitter news feed. I currently have 16,000+ messages in my Inbox - all I care is that they are all &quot;read&quot;. I star items that I will come back to and that require further action. <br /><br />Making your Inbox Zero is a superflous action that really doesn&#39;t achieve anything!</div>

Wait, so people think you&#39;re at Inbox Zero when you have no tasks left?  Who EVER has no tasks left?</div>
