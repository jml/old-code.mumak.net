I have a bit of a fetish for being able to hack offline. It's becoming increasingly old-fashioned, I know, but I'd like to think that eventually it will become a quirky and charming eccentricity, such as one might find in a British amateur sleuth.<br /><br />I wanted to get up and running with <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/">Juju</a>, <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>'s funky cloud orchestration thingy. We're doing a lot more service-oriented stuff in recent months, and it's very handy to be to just deploy something without having to faff about for a couple of hours. Since I'd like to stand a chance of doing this without a net connection, I set it up locally.<br /><br />With the help of the <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/CharmSchool">Charm School</a> page, the <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/provider-configuration-local.html">local provider docs</a> and the kind folk at #juju on Freenode, I got something up and running. Some notes about the experience:<br /><ul><li>I did all of this in precise, and it seemed to work just fine. I substituted 'precise' for 'oneiric' wherever I saw it.</li><li>I had to manually add my user to the <code>libvirtd</code> group. The instructions implied that this was not necessary.</li><li><code>juju bootstrap</code> finished very quickly for me and without any actual evidence that it had debootstrapped the whole OS.</li><li>When I deployed services, I didn't get any feedback that anything was going on. The recommended <code>debug-log</code> command showed very little output for a while. My guess is that this was while packages were downloading.</li></ul><div>All in all, pretty impressive. I'm really looking forward to mucking around with this a bit more</div></div>
