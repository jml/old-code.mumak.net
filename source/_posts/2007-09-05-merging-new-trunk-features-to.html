<a href="http://oubiwann.blogspot.com/">Oubiwann</a> has <a href="http://oubiwann.blogspot.com/2007/09/merging-new-trunk-features-to.html">recently posted</a> about the joys of using <a href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodCombinator">Combinator</a> to do branch-based development using Subversion. I thought it'd be fun to do the same post, except this time with Bazaar.<br /><h3>Background</h3><br />You're working on a project called "Project", you have a copy of the mainline branch (i.e. 'trunk') in your <code>src</code> directory.<br /><pre><br />~$ cd ~/src/Project<br />~/src/Project$ ls<br />trunk</pre><br />You want to implement a new feature, so you branch trunk to work on it:<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project$ bzr branch trunk viking-feature-836</pre><br />Bazaar is a version control system, not a PYTHONPATH-managing system, so it doesn't maintain a global list of projects and the branches that are currently active for each project.<br /><br />Perhaps your company focuses on historical invasions of Britain. You decide to start work on another feature:<br />lass objects.<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project$ bzr branch trunk norman-feature-1066</pre><br />You multi-task for a bit, until you finish 'viking-feature'. You decide to merge 'viking-feature-836' into trunk.<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project$ cd trunk<br />~/src/Project/trunk$ bzr merge ../viking-feature-836<br />~/src/Project/trunk$ bzr ci</pre><br />At this point, you begin to suspect that Bazaar treats branches as first-class objects. However, at this point, a developer on the obverse side of your continent calls you,<br /><br />"Where's your viking feature? I need it to invade Britain!"<br /><br />"I've just put it into trunk. Have you got the latest copy?"<br /><br />"Yeah, I do, I just pulled from trunk."<br /><br />"It's in trunk, you fool! ... Oh, wait, gimme a sec."<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project/trunk$ bzr push<br />Pushing to bzr+ssh://bzr.example.com/Project/trunk...<br />~/src/Project/trunk$</pre><br />"Try now."<br /><h3>Merging</h3><br />OK, enough background, let's merge.<br /><br />Say you need some of the changes in trunk in order to finish work on your norman feature. No problems.<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project$ bzr merge trunk norman-feature-1066<br />~/src/Project$ bzr ci -m "Merge from trunk."</pre><br />It's hard not to feel smug at this point.<br /><br />Wait a second, you also want to look at the experimental branch that a friend is working on:<br /><pre><br />~/src/Project/norman-feature-1066$ bzr merge bzr+ssh://yourfriend.example.com/branches/sealion-1946<br />~/src/Project/norman-feature-1066$ bzr diff | less # better double check this one<br />~/src/Project/norman-feature-1066$ bzr revert # nope, doesn't seem like a good idea</pre><br /><h3>Summary</h3><br />Bazaar treats branches as first-class objects and treats trunk just like any other branch. Although Combinator is great for branch-based development in Subversion, it is more complex and less flexible than doing branch-based development in Bazaar.<br /><br />With Combinator, you lose history when you merge in changes from trunk, with Bazaar you don't.<br /><br />With Combinator, you can only merge in changes from trunk, with Bazaar you can merge from any branch.<br /><br />With Combinator, merging from trunk leaves a bunch of changed files in the trunk checkout on your system (this has tripped me up more than once). With Bazaar, this doesn't happen.</div>
