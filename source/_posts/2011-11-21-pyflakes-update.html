Thanks to <a href="http://radix.twistedmatrix.com/">radix</a>, <a href="http://as.ynchrono.us/">exarkun</a> &amp; <a href="http://as.ynchrono.us/">dash</a>, my branch to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes">pyflakes</a> to warn about duplicate definitions of classes finally landed. I did the work a year ago as an outrage-powered, opportunistic fix after I saw a co-worker struggle with tests weirdly not failing (Turned out it was a huge test module and there was another class at the bottom with the same name). I'm very happy to see it landed.<br /><br />For those who haven't been paying attention, official pyflakes development is now taking place on <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> as part of the <a href="http://launchpad.net/divmod.org">divmod.org</a> project. The trunk of that project now has the best version of pyflakes known to man.<br /><br />pyflakes is the best static Python checker. It's fast, and has very few false positives.<br /><br /><b>Update: </b>A couple of people have asked me about <a href="https://launchpad.net/pyflakes">lp:pyflakes</a>. It's dead. It died when the divmorg.org trac instance died ages ago. Don't use it. To get pyflakes or any other divmod project, use <a href="https://launchpad.net/divmod.org">lp:divmod.org</a>.</div>

I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not a Pyflakes maintainer, and I only found out about the transfer of projects from the last pyflakes release announcement.</div>

Where should bugs be reported? lp:divmod.org doesn&#39;t have the bug-tracker configured.<br /><br />If lp:pyflakes is dead, why is it still linked to from pypi?</div>

Looking at the checker code, it&#39;s actually a pretty elegant use of the python ast module, and a big improvement on the mess of string handling generally found under the covers of python lint modules.</div>
