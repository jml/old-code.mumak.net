<div class='post'>
Didn't get around to posting last weekend, sorry. Next weekend I'll be at a conference in the north of Tasmania, so no post then either.<br /><br />Things in the works:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Automated testing as a community builder</li><br />	<li>Asynchronous functions</li><br />	<li>Asynchronous development methodologies</li><br /></ul><br />Also, <a href="http://glyf.livejournal.com">glyph</a> thinks that xUnit sucks, but hasn't bothered to explain why. So I want you to:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Tell me why xUnit sucks</li><br />	<li>Hassle glyph until he does 1.</li><br /></ol></div>
