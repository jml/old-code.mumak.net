The announcement is a few days late, but I thought that you'd like to know that <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools">testtools 0.9.8</a> has been released.<br /><br />This is one of our biggest releases, we have fixed <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools/0.9/0.9.8">a lot of bugs</a>, added experimental support for running tests inside Twisted's reactor and added a stack of new matchers and convenience methods. It's well worth upgrading.<br /><br />We've also got some good stuff in the pipeline, including a full re-working of our documentation, better error messages and still more matchers.<br /><br />The "more matchers" thing is significant. More and more people are starting to use testtools because of the way our matchers let them build domain-specific assertions with rich, useful error messages. We continue to get contributions for basic matchers and for new ways of combining matchers. Also, projects like James Westby's <a href="https://launchpad.net/soupmatchers">soupmatchers</a>&nbsp;show just how useful matchers can be. It makes me think that eventually matchers will become part of the normal way that people write tests in Python.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~lifeless">Robert Collins</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gz">Martin [gz]</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jelmer">Jelmer Vernooij</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mwhudson">Michael Hudson-Doyle</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~james-w">James Westby</a> for making this our best release ever.</div>
