I recently upgraded to Maverick beta. Here are my thoughts and observations:<br /><br /><ul><li>Despite the huge number of PPAs and unofficial debs I had on my system, the upgrade itself was very smooth</li><li>Everything looks much crisper, probably due to the <a href="http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/an-update-to-the-ubuntu-light-themes/">two</a> <a href="http://design.canonical.com/2010/08/second-update-to-the-ubuntu-light-themes/">updates</a> to the Light themes</li><li>Python 2.5 was removed. I work on software that still supports Python 2.4, so that's a pain</li><li>The keyboard indicator is nicer (I can read it), but it says "USA" when I want it to say "Dvorak"</li><li>The booting process is still flashes between screen resolutions, switches to black then back again</li><li>I still have to rmmod iwlagn; modprobe iwlagn sometimes</li><li>"Print to file" from Chrome produced a single blank page of PDF</li><li>I don't know how I feel about the Me &amp; Message menus</li></ul><div>I guess lots of these are bugs. They are, after all, easier to notice.</div></div>

<a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes" rel="nofollow">https://edge.launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes</a> looks useful: a PPA with python2.4 and python2.5 for Maverick (and Lucid).  That doesn&#39;t help with all the python libraries you might depend on, but it&#39;s something.<br /><br />I guess the comprehensive answer is &quot;run a virtual machine with Hardy&quot;.</div>
