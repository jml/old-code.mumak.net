<div class='post'>
The <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/">Launchpad Code home page</a> is now a little bit nicer and a little bit faster.<br /><br />For a while now, the page has had a tag cloud showing some projects that host branches on Launchpad. The tag cloud is drawn based on the following rules:<br /><ul><li>The more branches, the bigger the tag</li><li>The more recent the last commit, the less faded the tag<br /></li><li>If Launchpad is <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> place to go for getting the project's code, colour it green. Otherwise, blue.<br /></li></ul>Up until recently, the home page only showed some projects starting with 'A' -- which is a bit silly. My recent patch changed the query to show the most branch-y projects on Launchpad. It looks a lot nicer, IMO.<br /><br /><a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ebeuno">Martin Albisetti</a> has asked me to change the colours though. Expect an update soon.</div>
