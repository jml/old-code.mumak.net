Last release, Tim added a stealth feature to Launchpad. Since it's incomplete we didn't announce it on the official blog, but it's useful enough to share here.<br /><br />If you browse to https://code.launchpad.net/~$USERNAME/$PROJECT, you'll get a list of all the branches in $PROJECT owned by $USERNAME, e.g. <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/%7Eraof/do">Chris's Gnome Do branches</a> or <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Egmb/gwibber">Graham's Gwibber branches</a>. I use this mostly to track my own branches in a project so I can make sure I haven't let any slip through the cracks.<br /><br />We want to make it possible to get to these pages without URL hacking, of course. But if  you use both Bazaar and Launchpad quite heavily then this trick is worth knowing about even as it is.</div>

Unfortunately going to https://code.launchpad.net/~user/ubuntu doesn't list source package branches yet.</div>

Heh, I've been using this feature for a little while without realising it wasn't official yet.<BR/><BR/>I'm very glad to have it, it's very useful!</div>
