The Landscape guys mentioned three things that I've missed in <a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/your-code-sucks.html">Your Code Sucks and I Hate You</a>.<br /><br /><ul><li>The important thing about code reviews is that they are a conversation. Emphasise this in your team's code review culture.</li><li>Don't speak to the person, speak to the code. "Why does the code do this?" rather than "Why did you do this?".</li><li>Remember that the person who wrote the patch is an expert in that patch.</li></ul></div>
