There's been a clamor for more documentation on how to use <a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a>. While I'm not qualified to show you the <span style="font-style: italic;">best</span> way to use it, I can show you the way that I would begin to use it.<br /><br />The linked files are a bunch of unit tests for database code that uses <a href="http://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>. Where a real test suite might use an in-memory database, this test suite uses on on-disk sqlite database to better illustrate testresources. This database needs to be removed and built again after each test to guarantee test isolation.<br /><br />You'll need testresources, Storm and testtools in your Python import path to run these examples.<br /><br />The first file, <a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example.py">complex-example.py</a>, shows how I might do this without testresources. I create a DatabaseService class that has a setUp and tearDown of its own, and a get_store() method that tests are likely to use. This might not be the best thing for databases, but is very close to what I'd do for network services in tests, where I would need to start the service, stop it and have methods to get URLs, clients and other information about the service. If you run the file, you'll see that the database is <span style="font-style: italic;">created</span> at the start of each test, and <span style="font-style: italic;">destroyed</span> before the test finishes. In total, it's created and destroyed three times.<br /><br />The second file, <a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example-2.py">complex-example-2.py</a>, shows how to switch to using testresources. To do this I,<br /><ul><li>added a TestResource subclass called DatabaseResource that implements make() and clean() by delegating to a DatabaseService.</li><li>changed the test case to subclass ResourcedTestCase</li><li>added 'resources = [('database', DatabaseResource())] as a class variable of the test case.</li></ul>Instead of using DatabaseService() in the test, I could have, and perhaps should have, declared a module level instance of DatabaseResource. In that case, the code would have looked like:<br /><pre>class _DatabaseResource(TestResource):<br />...<br />DatabaseResource = _DatabaseResource()<br /><br />class TestPerson(unittest.TestPerson):<br />...<br />resources = [('database', DatabaseResource)]<br />...<br /></pre><br />Running the file shows that the behaviour is the same as the first example: the database is <span style="font-style: italic;">created</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">destroyed</span> in each test.<br /><br />The third file, <a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example-3.py">complex-example-3.py</a>, shows how to take advantage of OptimisingTestSuite (sic). We load the test suite as usual, <span style="font-style: italic;">adsorb</span> (sic) them into an OptimisingTestSuite and return that. We also have to explicity declare when a test <span style="font-style: italic;">dirties</span> the DatabaseResource. I chose to do this by adding a dirtied() method to the DatabaseService. If I had used a singleton (as above), then I would have just called dirtied on that.<br /><br />Anyway, if you run the third example, you'll see that the database is <span style="font-style: italic;">created</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">destroyed</span> outside the tests and that its only done <span style="font-style: italic;">twice</span>. The test suite has been optimized by sharing resources between tests when possible.<br /><br />I hope this helps explain how to use testresources. Certainly writing has been a useful exercise for me, it's highlighted that:<br /><ul><li>a list of 2-tuples isn't quite right for declaring which resources a test uses.</li><li>the dirtied API is inconvenient</li><li>TestResource remains a confusing name for the class, as it conflates the resource acquisition and cleanup with the actual <span style="font-style: italic;">resource</span>.</li><li>Some of the API docs are wrong (notably the ones for ResourcedTestCase).</li><li>The pattern of "resource object with setUp, tearDown, dirtied (and addCleanup)" should perhaps be turned into Python code.</li></ul>I long for your thoughts.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br /><a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example.py">complex-example.py</a><br /><a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example-2.py">complex-example-2.py</a><br /><a href="http://static.mumak.net/complex-example-3.py">complex-example-3.py</a><br /><br /><b>Update:</b> Correct links to example Python files.</div>

Not really. testresources may have changed a lot since I wrote this blog post. I&#39;m not using it day-to-day these days.<br /><br />Your best hope for getting help is to ask a question on  or to ask &#39;lifeless&#39; on the #python-testing channel on Freenode.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

Sorry to be a bother, but I&#39;m elbows deep in an implementation of testresources currently, and I&#39;m getting &quot;TypeError: make() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)&quot; in each test case (method of the ResourcedTestCase class).<br /><br />I went back and reconstructed the 3rd complex example from your .py and Storm, and I get the exact same error from testresources.__init__ (where I am getting it in mine).  Does this ring a bell?</div>

I&#39;m glad you liked it, and that it&#39;s still useful years later.<br /><br />In an ideal world, yes. However, there&#39;s no way for the test framework to predict which tests will dirty which resources. Within a group of tests that declare the same resources, they just run in alphabetical order.</div>

Thanks for posting this example.  I&#39;ve been struggling to understand testresource (coming from PyUnit backgroun) and your third example is the most helpful I&#39;ve seen so far.<br /><br />One question- why do you say the database gets created and destroyed <i>twice</i> in that example?  If they&#39;re optimized, shouldn&#39;t the test case that dirties the database be run last, then simply tear the db down at the end of the test run- so only <i>one</i> invocation of setup and tear down total?</div>
