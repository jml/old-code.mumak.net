Launchpad doesn't really have any good mechanism for letting you review a list of "your" projects.<br /><br />That's partly because there are a lot of different ways that it <i>could</i>&nbsp;do it. You could be the maintainer of a project, or its driver, or its bug supervisor, or you might have commit access to its trunk branch. All of this could be direct, or through membership of a team. It's tough.<br /><br /><br />Since it's that time of year when I review my projects, responsibilities, goals and the like and start to figure out what I want to do next year, I want to figure out what are my projects on Launchpad.<br /><br />Luckily, Launchpad has an API. I can't use it to figure out what projects I'm the maintainer of, but I can use it to figure out <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/783038/">what trunk branches I have commit access to</a>. &nbsp;The link has the Python code for the script.<br /><br />Really, Launchpad should allow me to curate my own list of projects, with input to that list coming from all of the sources mentioned above, as well as arbitrarily selecting projects.</div>
