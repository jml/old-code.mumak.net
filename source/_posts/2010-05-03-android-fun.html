I bought a Nexus One. I got sick of not having any decent todo applications for the Palm Pre, so I bought a shiny new Android phone. Some quick thoughts:<div><ul><li>Android has many apps, many of which are very cool</li><li>Buying an application is way too easy, given Google Checkout</li><li>I can't seem to get 3G data access from the Nexus One</li><li>WebOS has a much nicer UI for multi-tasking</li><li>Wonder if I can get on IRC via my SSH tunneled bip connection</li></ul><div><b>Update:</b> I now have 3G access, thanks to these instructions for <a href="http://forum.o2.co.uk/viewtopic.php?p=144262#144262">getting 3G from O2 on Android phones</a>.</div></div></div>
