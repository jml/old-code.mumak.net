<em>The Economist</em> occasionally publishes a "Big Mac Index" — how much the world's favorite "burger" costs in each country, translated into a common currency.<br /><br />Why they don't publish an index of how much an issue of the Economist costs?  All of my issues have the price of the newspaper in lots of Asia-Pacific currencies. A small sample:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Australia, 9.39855 USD</li><br />	<li>Cambodia, 6.00 USD</li><br />	<li>China, 10.43655 USD</li><br />	<li>Hong Kong, 7.6917 USD</li><br />	<li>India, 5.0522 USD</li><br />	<li>Japan, 10.70535 USD</li><br />	<li>New Zealand, 8.6669 USD</li><br /></ul><br />Can anyone tell me why the price varies so much?</div>
