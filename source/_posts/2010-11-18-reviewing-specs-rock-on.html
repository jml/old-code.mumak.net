<div class='post'>
I just finished reviewing a bunch of <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP">LEP</a>s, which are the specs Launchpadders write for doing new feature work. I've been looking at a bunch of the <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/PrivateProjectsAndDistributions">privacy</a> LEPs and one on <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/Code/MergeQueues/LEP">merge queues</a>. &nbsp;It's been great to see such good, clear thinking, and also to see people thinking and writing in terms of constraints and requirements ("What do we want? Why?") instead of implementation or potential solutions.<br /><br />Basically I've got a bunch of scribbled-on bits of paper right now. Tomorrow I'm going to update the wiki &amp; schedule calls with the developers so we can kick them along.</div>
