<div class='post'>
I mentioned <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2010/11/and-then-what.html">a while ago</a> that I really want to see something like a dashboard in Launchpad, some kind of view that shows you everything that you <i>must</i>&nbsp;do, everything that you are waiting on from others and&nbsp;all of your current work-in-progress. Launchpad could do this really well, since it has rich, inter-linked data about what's going on and since it can show you this information for all of your projects.<br /><br />Today, I knocked up a very quick-and-dirty prototype for this. It shows all of the work-in-progress for a person across all of Launchpad, grouped by project.<br /><br />The code lives at <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/+junk/whip">lp:~jml/+junk/whip</a> and you can see examples of <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jml/jml-wip.html">my work-in-progress</a> and <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jml/jelmer-wip.html">jelmer's work-in-progress</a> online. You should be able to make your own with './bin/whip $LP-NAME &gt; wip.html'. Note that there'll be some PYTHONPATH shenanigans.<br /><br />Hackers, I'd love to see if you could turn this prototype into a web-app, or even a page on Launchpad. There's a NOTES file in there with whatever ideas I've had.<br /><br />Designers, there's got to be a better way of showing this data than what I've picked. Take a look at the examples and see what you can turn them into.</div>
