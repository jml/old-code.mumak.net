<div class='post'>
At the Launchpad Epic, I presented a paper on Twisted for the other Launchpadders. I think that the paper itself is a good introduction to how Twisted works and why, and I'll be publishing it here once I get a chance to format it for the web.<br /><br />I did two lightning talks that might be interesting to readers. One was on <a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a> and the other was on how to hack like an Evil Overlord. I think I'll try present the second one at OSDC.</div>
