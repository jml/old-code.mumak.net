Very, very recently, we changed Launchpad to <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bug/237465">support team +junk branches</a>. So recently, in fact, I don't think the change has hit the servers yet. Anyway, after the 2.2.3 release on April 1, you'll be able to push up &amp; create branches in lp:~your-team-here/+junk/some-branch.<br /><br />I have to confess I'm not a huge fan of this feature. Almost all of the time, if you've got some code in a branch and you want others to collaborate on it you should <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/projects/+new-guided">create a new project</a>. That way you can file bugs, do code reviews and get easy branch stacking support.<br /><br />Still, the use case that <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaserjock">Jordan</a> mentions is a good one, and the fix fell out naturally from some of the work we've done for source package branches, so we decided to do it. You see, we actually do get a kick out of making our users happy. Really.<br /><br />I guess the moral of the story, if there is one at all, is to <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+filebug">file bug reports</a>. We don't want to build a website with <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/The_Homer_by_Carlos_Bisquertt.jpg">separate bubble domes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F">three horns that all play "La Cucaracha"</a> so we aren't going to mindlessly say "yes" to everything. But we do want to make something that will help you rock the Free Software world even harder, and to do that, we need to know what you want.</div>

Out of curiosity, what was Jordan's use case?</div>
