From the Emacs help<br /><blockquote>C-x C-- runs the command text-scale-adjust, which is an interactive autoloaded<br />Lisp function.<br /><br />It is bound to C-x C-+, C-x C--, C-x C-=, C-x C-0.<br /><br />(text-scale-adjust &amp;optional INC)<br /><br />Increase or decrease the height of the default face in the current buffer.<br /><br />The actual adjustment made depends on the final component of the<br />key-binding used to invoke the command, with all modifiers removed:<br /><br />   +, =   Increase the default face height by one step<br />   -      Decrease the default face height by one step<br />   0      Reset the default face height to the global default<br /></blockquote>C-x C-- is really, really close to C-x C-s on a Dvorak keyboard. If ever you hit it by accident, hit C-x C-0 to get your Emacs looking right.</div>
