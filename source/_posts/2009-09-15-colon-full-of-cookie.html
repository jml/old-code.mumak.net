Launchpad does translations. You can register a project on Launchpad and use Launchpad to translate your software into a zillion other languages. We've even got funky tools to take the translations that people do on the web and commit them straight to your branch.<br /><br />As an ignorant Anglophonic monoglot, I've never really looked into Launchpad Translations. Software is already written in my language, and I can't help translate it into my language. There has been no reason for me to look at it... until today.<br /><br />Barry Warsaw, hacker extraordinaire, has started a project called <a href="https://launchpad.net/colon-full-of-cookie">I have a colon full of cookie</a>. This project aims to translate the phrase "I have a colon full of cookie" into as many languages as possible. Note here that "colon" is the organ, not the punctuation mark.<br /><br />OK, time to bust out my Latin lexicon.</div>
