<div class='post'>
I'm trying to get Ubuntu 10.10 running in a VM on my iMac. It mostly works with either VirtualBox or VMWare Fusion, but I can't get 3D acceleration working. Under VirtualBox, I can get compositing happening, but it's very slow. Under VMWare Fusion, Ubuntu won't even acknowledge that I have a 3D card. Help.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;If you can point me to a <i>working</i>&nbsp;guide for dual booting Ubuntu on the iMac 27", then that would also be great.</div>

Following up, I tried to boot with the Ubuntu 10.10 CD with rEFIt installed and all I got was the screen flashing to aubergine, then to 80x25 console then black, all the while the CD was spinning and being read from.<br /><br />I guess I&#39;ll have a poke around some other sites.</div>

Compositing works for me too in Parallels 6 -- if you&#39;re virtualizing in OS X I strongly recommend Parallels.<br /><br />Note that when dual-booting, it actually doesn&#39;t matter if you install GRUB to the MBR or the partition -- Mac EFI does the right thing (tm) in either case, and you can&#39;t break your OS X boot anyway.</div>

(Something I&#39;ve singularly failed to do with any of VBox, Fusion or Parallels though is be able to boot my native dual-boot partition in a VM. They all try to help me boot my Windows Boot Camp partition in the VM and get confused that it&#39;s not NTFS and will give up)</div>

Compositing works ok in Parallels.<br />As for dual booting, it should Just Work with 10.04.1 or later - the only non-standard wrinkles are:<br /> * Install GRUB to the partition not the MBR<br /> * Install rEFIt on the Mac so you can select which OS to boot.<br /><br />I&#39;d ignore the Boot Camp tools as they are rather too focussed on Windows.</div>

Have you tried using the bootcamp assistant and just installing it the same way you&#39;d dual-boot with Windows? That works quite fine on any Mac I&#39;ve tried it out before.</div>
