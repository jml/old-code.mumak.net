<a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/125">Mark Shuttleworth:</a><br /><blockquote>What’s good enough performance? Well, I like to think in terms of “heartbeat time”. If the major operations which I have to do regularly (several times in an hour) take less than a heartbeat, then I don’t ever feel like I’m waiting. Things which happen 3-5 times in a day can take a bit longer, up to a minute, and those fit with regular workbreaks that I would take anyhow to clear my head for the next phase of work, or rest my aching fingers.</blockquote><br />Take this rule of thumb and apply it to unit tests:<br /><ul><br /> <li>Tests for whatever chunk of code you are working on should take "less than a heartbeat".</li><br /> <li>Your <em>entire</em> testing suite (that you run 3-5 times in a day, right?) can take longer to run, up to a minute.</li><br /></ul><br />Authors of tests and testing frameworks, there's your challenge.<br /><br />Tests that take too long to run just won't get run. Programmers will postpone running the suite until the last possible moment. When using something like <a href="https://launchpad.net/pqm">PQM</a> or <a href="http://buildbot.net">Buildbot</a>, this can be disastrous. Other developers might have to wait hours for their code to land on trunk.<br /><br />Gerard Mezsaros's new book, <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/"><em>xUnit Test Patterns</em></a> has some good ideas about what to do and what <em>not</em> to do to make your tests run in a couple of heartbeats.</div>
