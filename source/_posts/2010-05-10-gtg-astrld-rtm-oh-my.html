<a href="http://weloveastrid.com/">I love Astrid</a>, and have really enjoyed getting the four hundred tasks I have into it and synced with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>. I almost love <a href="http://gtg.fritalk.com/">Getting Things GNOME</a>, and thought I'd experiment a bit getting my tasks synced from RTM on to my desktop using GTG.<div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately, I ballsed something up, and now all of my four hundred tasks from RTM have been deleted. Sad. They are all still on Astrid though. Happy. But when I sync from Astrid to Remember the Milk, none of those four hundred tasks are uploaded. Sad.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you know how I can get my tasks back on to RTM, can you please comment here, or on the <a href="https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/astrid/+question/110188">question I asked on Launchpad</a>.</div></div>

It sounds like GTG ballsed something up.  Whatever it was that made you delete all of your work should probably be reported as a a bug :).<br /><br />I am reminded of <a href="http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html" rel="nofollow">Havoc Pennington&#39;s screed on the subject</a>.  Get them to fix whatever in the UI did not put a GIANT molly-guard over this feature :).</div>
