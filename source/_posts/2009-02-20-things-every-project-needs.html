I'm reviewing my checklists right now. I just came across one that I'd like some help with. It's called "Things every project needs", and it currently has this:<br /><ul><li>TODO system (e.g. specs, trackers, text file, bzr difftodo)</li><li>Version control</li><li>List of dependencies</li><li>One step build</li><li>One step build-and-run-tests</li><li>One step build-and-run<br /></li><li>One step build-docs (API, testdoc, general docs, sphinx)<br /></li><li>Version information</li><li>License<br /></li></ul>I hope you see the sort of thing I mean. I mean things you have to do (or at least think about) when starting any software project.<br /><br />Can you think of anything to add?</div>

I'm not sure I agree on all of this - why does build-and-run-tests need to be one step?  Why can't distro packagers take care of build-and-run?<BR/><BR/>Here's a few more though.<BR/><BR/>- Documented build-run-tests-upload-release.  (Maybe this is why you need build-and-run-tests?  I still disagree that it absolutely must be one step.)<BR/><BR/>- Documented release announcement procedure.  (Unlikely to get this down to one step though because there are many places to announce a project, not all of them belong to you.)  Basically, <A HREF="http://wiki.goonmill.org/HowtoReleaseHypy" REL="nofollow">this document</A>.<BR/><BR/>Releasing should be done <I>early and often</I>.  Therefore, it must be easy.</div>
