I want to get a shiny new monitor and keyboard. The monitor is for coding, writing docs, answering emails and watching films. The keyboard is for same. They'll both plug into my Thinkpad X200 for now.<div><br /></div><div>I'm tempted to get an Apple Cinema Display (but at such cost!). I don't know what keyboard I want. I think that the DAS keyboard I have isn't it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thoughts?</div></div>

Lenovo now sell external keyboards which are small and have a built in pointing device <br /><br />Don&#39;t stint on the screen!  Get a 30in or at least 24.</div>

I use Fujitsu-Siemens badged split keyboards.  e.g.     http://ts.fujitsu.com/products/prof_accessories_mainboards/keyboards_mice/special_keyboards/kbpc_e.html<br /><br />The split really relaxes shoulders and wrists thereby lowering the hassle of RSI etc.</div>

I&#39;ve been very happy with my Samsung 305T.  It&#39;s 30&quot;, 2560x1600.  I know lots of people prefer to work with two 24&quot; displays, but the extra vertical space is really nice for coding.</div>

I have a proper diNovo Edge and I love it to bits. Great tactile response, really slim (I like flat keyboards, but that might be a personal taste). It doesn&#39;t have a keypad which for me is a massive plus, but I realise for others may be a problem. Also, not cheap.<br /><br />I also recently bought a Dell ST2410 24&quot;. It&#39;s probably the nicest monitor I&#39;ve used. Really good colours. All the proper HDMI connections etc. Probably a good choice if price is at all an issue.<br /><br />Hrm, might sound a bit over positive, but they&#39;re probably the best two bits of hardware I&#39;ve ever bought.</div>

I&#39;m tappin&#39; away on a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard/devices/4742&amp;cl=au,en" rel="nofollow">Logitech diNovo Laptop keyboard</a> at the moment. It&#39;s a wonderful piece of kit, if expensive.<br /><br />As far as displays are concerned, I&#39;m not sure that the end result is worth paying the Apple tax compared to other brands. Do your homework.</div>

I love my Eclipse II keyboard. It&#39;s very unclicky, but probably the same size as the DAS. Certainly not a low profile keyboard.</div>

I just bought a BenQ full HD 21&quot; monitor for almost nothing (NZ$250) and I&#39;m pretty happy with it.  It&#39;s not perfect by any stretch, but for coding it&#39;s fine.  For watching films you might want to spend a bit more I guess.<br /><br />My keyboard is from &quot;that keyboard and mouse company&quot; -- a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and I quite like it.  I definitely prefer split keyboard but I know some people hate them...</div>

I&#39;m looking at monitors as well for my x200.  At the moment this IPS panel seems to be getting good reviews and is a reasonable price (NEC EA231WMI-BK).  Here&#39;s a good review of it:<br /><br />http://www.prad.de/en/monitore/review/2009/review-nec-ea231wmi-bk-part14.html<br /><br />It&#39;s 1920x1200, but I haven&#39;t checked it will actually work with the x200 yet. Also 23&quot; might be a bit big for the office ;-)</div>

Being so very used to laptop keyboards, I&#39;m happy with the Logitech UltraX. Quite slim, not clicky.</div>

Iiyama monitors are excellent in terms of colour reproduction and sharpness. I don&#39;t know how they compare to Apple cinema displays, though.</div>

I have an Apple Cinema Display at home and I love it. But beware, the latest models use a funky connector which you may have to get an adapter to use with a PC or an old Mac.</div>

The DAS keyboard is clicky, and I&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s not for me. It&#39;s also way way too big.</div>

I personally really like Unicomp keyboards which are basically Modern manufactured IBM Model M Keyboards. They&#39;re clicky (which may not be for everyone) but this provides excellent feedback and means you don&#39;t have to hit the keys so hard as you do with rubber dome keyboards. See http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/keyboards.html<br /><br />On the monitor front I&#39;m just looking into what&#39;s available myself. Top of my list is the Eizo 2243 which is a 1920x1200 screen (PVA panel with overdrive) in a 22&quot; format alternatives to that would be Dell u2410 or HP2475. Both of those are IPS panels with the same 1920x1200 but 24&quot; diagonal.<br /><br />All of the above are higher quality panels for greater colour accuracy and better viewing angles and should be similar quality or better to Apple&#39;s Cinema displays.<br /><br />HTH</div>
