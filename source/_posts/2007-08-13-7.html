<div class='post'>
My headphones broke and I'm chasing down an erratic test failure with no real leads.<br /><br />And yet Prince stands:<br /><br /><blockquote> All 7 and well watch them fall<br />They stand in the way of love<br />And we will smoke them all<br />With an intellect and a savoir-faire<br />No one in the whole universe<br />Will ever compare<br />I am yours now and u are mine<br />And together well love through<br />All space and time, so dont cry<br />One day all 7 will die</blockquote></div>
