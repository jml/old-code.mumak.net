I had a great time at PyCon 2010. The best part was definitely the <a href="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2010/03/pycon-2010-sprint-report.html">Twisted sprint</a>, which gave me a long overdue opportunity to do some actual coding.<br /><br />Well, actually, I ended up spending a lot of the time organizing a release and writing <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess">process documents</a>, so I didn't escape management as much as I would have liked.<br /><br />Now I'm back, planning on doing the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4290">Twisted 10.0 release</a> and working with <a href="http://launchpad.net/~didrocks">didrocks</a> to get better <a href="http://help.launchpad.net/API">Launchpad integration</a> with <a href="http://launchpad.net/quickly">Quickly</a>, as my contribution to <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/02/04/project-awesome-opportunity/">Project Awesome Opportunity</a>.</div>
