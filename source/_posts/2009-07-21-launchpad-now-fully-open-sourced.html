<div class='post'>
<a href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> has been <a href="http://blog.canonical.com/?p=192">open sourced</a>. That includes Soyuz and Codehosting.<br /><br />I'm now a full-time free software hacker. Squee!<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Mark</a> for making the call, and to <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/">Karl</a> for being the flux capacitor of the whole operation, humming along as we've built up to 1.21 gigawatts of <span style="font-style: italic;">freedom power</span> and burst right through to the future.</div>
