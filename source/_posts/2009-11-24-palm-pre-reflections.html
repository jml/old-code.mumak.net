<div class='post'>
I got a Palm Prē yesterday. Here are some initial thoughts.<div><ul><li>I like the feel of the physical device</li><li>The keyboard is small</li><li>Camera is useless for taking photos of receipts</li><li>The gesture UI is great</li><li>The Mail application shows individual emails, rather than GMail-style conversations. Lame.</li><li>I don't know how to get my lists out of text files on my computer and onto the Palm</li><li>I don't know actually know anything about syncing from the Palm</li><li>I still don't regret not getting an iPhone</li></ul></div></div>

Can&#39;t help but agree with you not regretting not having an iPhone. The Pre does everything I need *and* I can hack about with it a lot more than I could an iPhone without violating any contracts.</div>

I have had my Pre for just over a week now and I love it. It isn&#39;t perfect but it works great for what I need.</div>
