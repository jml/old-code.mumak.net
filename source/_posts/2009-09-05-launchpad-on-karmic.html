Thanks almost entirely to <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Emaxb">maxb</a> &amp; <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ewgrant">wgrant</a>, I can now hack on <a href="http://dev.launchpad.net/LaunchpadOnKarmic">Launchpad in Karmic</a>.<br /><br />This is great news for me, since it means I can ditch the chroot I was using. Check out the <a href="http://dev.launchpad.net">dev wiki</a> for more details.</div>
