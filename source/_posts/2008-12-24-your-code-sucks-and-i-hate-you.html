<div class='post'>
I've just uploaded my OSDC 2008 paper, titled <a href="http://mumak.net/stuff/your-code-sucks.html">Your Code Sucks and I Hate You</a>. It's about the social dynamics of code review.<br /><br />Tell me what you think.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> The paper was lost, now it's found.</div>

Sorry about that! I reinstalled my server and lost some data. I'll restore the talk as soon as I get the chance -- I'm on a business trip at the moment.</div>

Te link appears to be broken. I read this post on the past and it seemed quite good. I'd like to review it. Thanks.</div>

Nice paper, Jono!<BR/><BR/>I think you're missing a "least" in this sentence, though.  "If a chunk of code has been reviewed by someone else, then there are at [least] two people in the world who can understand it."</div>

Well summarised !<BR/><BR/>You mention that in the case of disputed matters, the patch reviewer makes the final decision in the case of Bazaar. It seems to me like that usually when there is disagreement between the patch author and the review(ers) the patch gets stalled and eventually the project leader (Martin) makes the final decision.</div>
