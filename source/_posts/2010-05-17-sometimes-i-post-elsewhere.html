This blog is about code, programming, developer collaboration and my technology woes. I have <a href="http://life.mumak.net">another blog</a> where I talk about pretty much everything else that I find interesting.<div><br /></div><div>They are split up because a lot of the readers of <a href="http://life.mumak.net">Echo and Bounce</a> have no interest and little understanding of the minutiae of Python hacking, and because <a href="http://code.mumak.net">Mere Code</a> is syndicated out to stacks of planets where the readers probably don't care about <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2010/05/book-of-you-and-dammit-list.html">my thoughts on Puritans and business yoga probloggers</a>, or <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2009/05/meditations-on-garbage-bin.html">why I think garbage bins are so great</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you <i>do</i> find that sort of stuff interesting, I warmly invite you to subscribe to my other blog, <a href="http://life.mumak.net">Echo and Bounce</a>, or to my <a href="http://mumak.net/planet/rss20.xml">combined RSS feed</a>.</div></div>
