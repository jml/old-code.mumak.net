Long time readers will know of my attempts to get Ubuntu running on my iMac. Now that I'm working within the Ubuntu Engineering team at Canonical, I figured it would be a good time to try again.<br /><br />Installing natively fails on 11.04 in the same way that it failed on 10.10: the installer sends output to the Mini DisplayPort rather than the actual screen. I don't have an external monitor that I can hook up to the DisplayPort, so that's pretty much that.<br /><br />I can still run a VM, right? VirtualBox is pretty good, and I got me a running install of Ubuntu with the Unity shell without too much fuss. Problem comes with keyboard configuration. The literal keypresses Cmd+H and Cmd+Q are not passed through to the guest OS. With a Dvorak layout these become Cmd+D and Cmd+", and if one maps Cmd to Meta then you cannot easily kill-word in Emacs. That means for me to have a useful environment, I'd have to make do with Super and Meta swapped around from the usual PC layout.<br /><br />VM Fusion doesn't have this problem and has a nicer UI, but I can't run Unity or compiz under it. This makes Ubuntu feel really old and clunky, and I'd rather not do that.<br /><br />Parallels, well, at this point I'm running out of the will.<br /><br />Think I'll settle on VirtualBox for the time being.</div>
