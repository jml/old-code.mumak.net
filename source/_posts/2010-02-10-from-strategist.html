<div>If I don't dump a bunch of stuff that's on my mind, I'll never blog again. Here goes:</div><ul><li>Launchpad users within Canonical seem to appreciate the <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/RoadMap">Roadmap</a>. Still receive some complaints about not communicating our plans enough, but not sure what to do.</li><li>Team lead meeting in London went well. Good to see the gang again.</li><li>The Wellington sprint was amazing. Rarely seen a sprint that's more productive.</li><li>My favourite result: a fixed, pre-planned annual schedule of sprints, including <i>two</i> annual whole-team sprints. I get to meet with my colleagues <i>and</i> have a life and Canonical saves money all at once.</li><li>The team leads like the <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/ReadyToCode">Ready-to-Code</a> and <a href="https://dev.launchpad.net/LaunchpadEnhancementProposalProcess">Launchpad Enhancement Proposal</a> process things.</li><li>Daily builds work is going well. There's a lot of UI bits to consider, and we're trying to get the UI correct before building it. Grates my JFDI nerves, but maybe it's the right approach.</li><li>Challenged the Launchpad team leads to blog once every two weeks about anything, as long as it's vaguely related to Launchpad. The name of the challenge? Blog like it's 2006.</li><li><a href="https://help.launchpad.net/HelpRotation">Community Help Rotation</a> sucks and basically no-one really knows what to do about it.</li><li>I'm cautiously excited about using kanban to track our work-in-progress.</li><li>Launchpad needs graphs in the Launchpad application. I think all we need is someone to just add one. I don't have the time to do it as part of my day job, and I've got a backlog of other hacking tasks. Could I help you do it instead?</li><li>I'm going to PyCon.</li></ul></div>
