Sometimes, sadly, Launchpad doesn't behave as well as we'd like.<div><br /></div><div>Although we try extremely hard to always be available, and take each instance of downtime (planned or unplanned) as a personal insult, sometimes we're forced to disappoint both our users and ourselves. It's no excuse, of course, but at least we're in <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">good</a> <a href="https://mail.google.com/">company</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>To make these inevitable interruptions easier to swallow, we've set up <a href="http://identi.ca/launchpadstatus">identi.ca</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/launchpadstatus">Twitter</a> accounts that report the Launchpad server statuses, and only the server statuses. We've got people all around the world who are able to update it when things go bump in the night. There's also a link to the identi.ca page in our footer, so you don't have to keep consulting a blog.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks very much to <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/">Matt Revell</a> for getting this done.</div></div>
