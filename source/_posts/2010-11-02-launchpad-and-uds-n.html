Yesterday I got back from the <a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a> where hundreds of people got together to plan the next release of Ubuntu, the "Natty Narwhal".<br /><br />For Natty, the Ubuntu Platform team have five foci:<br /><br /><ol><li>Unity</li><li>2D Experience</li><li>Software Center</li><li>Testing</li><li>Community contributions</li></ol><div>If you have a problem with these, <a href="http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2010/10/this-is-it.html">talk to the hand</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>We on the Launchpad team want to do everything we can to help Ubuntu achieve these goals. &nbsp;Partly, this will be by continuing to make Launchpad a joy to use. &nbsp;However we'll probably be able to offer some specific help with the last three foci: Software Center; testing and community contributions.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know of any concrete actions yet – I've yet to trawl through the many blueprints to find them – but for the next few months, I'm hoping that Launchpad developers will be watching for opportunities to help make Natty the best release ever.</div></div>
