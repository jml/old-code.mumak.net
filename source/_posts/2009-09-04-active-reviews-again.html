You might remember I was really excited about the first version of the active reviews page, since it let me see at a glance the code reviews I needed to do, the ones I was waiting on, and reviews I could do if I felt like it. At the time, this was really important, since it's the first time I've seen a code collaboration tool orient itself towards me actually doing things. It's certainly a first for Launchpad.<br /><br />Tim has recently landed a few changes to the page that aren't quite as revolutionary, but follow the same lines of thinking.<br /><br />The one I want to mention is putting all the branches that are approved for landing onto the active reviews page. Every branch that's approved to land and hasn't yet landed is actually waste, it's an improvement that's sitting around gathering dust and waiting for someone to push a button. It's like a winning lottery ticket stuck to your fridge because you're too lazy to cash it in. We think it's so important that we've put these at the top of the list.<br /><br />You can take a look at the active reviews pages for:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/+activereviews">Jonathan Lange</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/%7Ejml/launchpad/+activereviews">Jonathan Lange in Launchpad</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad/+activereviews">Launchpad</a></li><li><a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/people/+me/+activereviews">Yourself</a></li></ul>Now if you'll excuse me, I have branches to land.</div>

I&#39;m very happy they&#39;re all now on one fridge, not stuck in the bottom drawer.<br /><br />https://code.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+activereviews<br /><br />The first three headings<br /><br />&quot;Approved reviews ready to land&quot;<br />&quot;Requested reviews I can do&quot;<br />&quot;Reviews I am waiting on&quot;<br /><br />all sound pretty clear<br /><br />&quot;Reviews I am doing&quot; presumably means it is somehow stuck to me like the tar baby.  I don&#39;t know how to get things off this list - I already voted on them.<br /><br />&quot;Other reviews I am not actively reviewing&quot; is just a long way of saying &quot;Other&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what I should do with these things.  I&#39;m waiting on them, I&#39;m not reviewing them, and they&#39;re not reviews I can do.  In theory.  But really these are all reviews on my project so I should be able to do something with them.</div>

Why does your personal code review page have a nice little version of your profile pic and mine has the generic person icon?<br /><br />Is there some setting for this that I can&#39;t seem to find?<br /><br />Or I&#39;m just avatar unlucky? :)</div>
