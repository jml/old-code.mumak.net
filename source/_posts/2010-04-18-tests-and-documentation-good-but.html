I've long held that doctests are no way to test code. Andrew Bennetts explains the problems with <a href="http://bemusement.org/diary/2008/October/23/narrative-tests">narrative tests</a> and why <a href="http://bemusement.org/diary/2008/October/24/more-doctest-problems">tests are better written in code rather than text</a>.<div><br /></div><div>Recently, the Zope developer community has started taking these ideas seriously, and is <a href="https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2010-April/040160.html">starting to change its testing strategy</a>. This can only be a win for them: better test coverage and documentation driven by user needs.</div><div><br /></div></div>
