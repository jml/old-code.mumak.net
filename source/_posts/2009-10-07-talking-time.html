I've been working on the Launchpad team for a while, with most of that time being in Australia. Others in the team are in the US (red states &amp; blue states), the UK, Germany, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Serbia, Lithuania and Thailand.<div><br /></div><div>Here are some tips I've picked up for smoother online conversations, particularly around scheduling.</div><div><ul><li>Don't say "summer" or "fall". Say the month, or the range of months.</li><li>Say "my morning" rather than "the morning".</li><li>Use 24-hour time.</li><li>In real-time conversations, say "in 2 hours time" rather than "at 10".</li><li>Always include the timezone. Avoid using local abbreviations (e.g. PST), instead use offset from UTC.</li><li>Better still, just give the time in UTC.</li><li>Know your UTC offset.</li><li>Use a timezone-aware <a href="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html">meeting planner</a>. You'll get the arithmetic wrong otherwise.</li><li>Say "Oct 7" rather than 10/7 or 7/10. Everyone speaks English, but not everyone uses your dialect.</li><li>The time that you end a meeting is more important than when you start it. Thoughtfully consider the timezones of other attendees when you are planning for &amp; participating in meetings.</li></ul><div>Violating these rules isn't a big deal, since people can generally figure out what you mean. Following them, however, can speed things along and sometimes even avoid tedious conversations.</div></div></div>

Here&#39;s another one: people outside of your local area won&#39;t necessarily know when or if you observe daylight saving.<br /><br />If you schedule a recurring meeting according to a time zone that observes DST, then don&#39;t be surprised if people get confused around the transition times.</div>

“Use 24 hour time”: yes. Also, use ISO-8601 date formats, i.e. 2009-10-07. It&#39;s unambiguous between locales, *and* you get to know what year the writer was talking about.<br /><br />Why are USAians so averse to putting the danged *year* in their dates?</div>

Michael, Mary, yes, avoiding local abbreviations&quot; is important.<br /><br />I wish I thought of the &quot;today&quot; thing.</div>

Also, some of the local timezone acronyms are ambiguous: both USians and Australians call their eastern time zone EST/EDT.<br /><br />So, what Michael said.</div>

I think all of those things are very good bits of advice, although I&#39;d perhaps have put them in a different order.  The one I&#39;d really like to bash into people&#39;s heads is to either give times in UTC or local time &amp; UTC offset.  I can never remember what EDT or PST and so on are.<br /><br />I would also say:<br /><br /> * be careful talking about days, particularly when close the date line.  My Tuesday is not the same as Jamu&#39;s Tuesday, or at least not for very long.<br /><br /> * DST sucks bright red donkey balls.</div>

Agreed.  I&#39;d add &quot;Use the metric system&quot;.</div>
