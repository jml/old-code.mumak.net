I think Ted has a good point there, although I think the solution is more along the lines of not having releases in the same way.  I know Bjorn has been working on this, I hope it results in something soon!<br /><br />Deryck&#39;s &quot;Websites Don&#39;t Release Anything&quot; blog post is obviously relevant here.</div>

I think one issue might be the monthly releases.  There&#39;s no reason to rush a feature in because it&#39;s easy to push for next month.  Perhaps having a *longer* release cycle would put more presure on finishing a feature for a particular release.</div>
