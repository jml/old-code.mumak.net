<div class='post'>
I don't get a whole lot of time to hack on things outside of work. Maybe one or two slots of about two hours in a good week. What I want is for that time to be fun, creative, and hopefully useful for others.<br /><br />When I do get such discretionary time, what I often end up doing is code review. I believe that finishing things is more important than starting them, and know how much it sucks to be waiting for someone to review your code.<br /><br />So, I'll do a couple of code reviews (some of which might be strictly blocking on me). And then I'll run out of time.<br /><br />This means I rarely work on anything I actually find fun. Code reviews are rarely fun.<br /><br />There's a similar, related thing working on a project that's got a backlog of code reviews, like, say Twisted. Twisted has forty or fifty patches right now that are waiting for someone to review them. Do I want to fix bugs in Twisted? That would be contributing to the patch problem, so probably not. Do I want to do code reviews? Well, I guess I should, but I'll probably find something else to do instead.<br /><br />I don't think Twisted should change its policy. I think the solution is for people like me to volunteer more time doing something they don't necessarily enjoy for the sake of achieving some broader, nobler outcome.<br /><br />However, for me to sustain myself and keep enjoying open source and my chosen career, I've decided to make sure that I regularly schedule "naughty time". That's going to be time where I don't work on the thing that I should be working on, but instead play with something I find interesting at the time, even if it's not the best thing to do.</div>
