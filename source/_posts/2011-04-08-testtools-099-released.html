<div class='post'>
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools">testtools</a> 0.9.9 has been released today. For me, the twin pillars of this release have been our <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/testtools/en/latest/">vast documentation improvements</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/testtools/en/latest/for-test-authors.html#matchers">the new matchers</a>, which make it very, very easy to make meaningful assertions about complex objects. Well worth checking out.<div><br /></div><div>Thanks to&nbsp;Christian Kampka, Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley,&nbsp;Jelmer Vernooij and Michael Hudson-Doyle their contributions.</div></div>
