Just found out that there's <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~subunit/+archive/ppa">a PPA with the latest releases of a whole bunch of Python testing goodies</a>, including:<div><ul><li><a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools">testtools</a> - Extensions to unittest that make real extensions possible</li><li><a href="https://launchpad.net/testresources">testresources</a> - Safely re-use expensive resources in tests without paying massive set-up costs</li><li><a href="https://launchpad.net/subunit">subunit</a> - Manipulate, exchange and analyze test results without writing code</li><li><a href="https://launchpad.net/testscenarios">testscenarios</a> - Run the same tests against many different implementations</li></ul><div>If you are running Ubuntu 9.10 or later, then <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:subunit</code> will add it to your apt sources.</div><div><br /></div><div>We're starting to grow a lot of useful, small testing tools that become even more useful when combined. I really like the "small pieces, loosely joined" approach, but sometimes that can make deployment &amp; dependency management a colossal pain. Happily, Ubuntu, <a href="http://rbtcollins.wordpress.com/">Rob</a> and <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">Launchpad PPAs</a> to the rescue.</div></div></div>
