If you've got a Palm Pre and you want to be able to synchronize tasks from the Pre to <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a>, then please start hacking on <a href="http://launchpad.net/cowtasks">CowTasks</a>.<div><br /></div><div>The original author has given up development, open sourced it and I've put it on Launchpad. I don't have the time to maintain it either, but I'd love it if someone did.</div><div><br /></div></div>
