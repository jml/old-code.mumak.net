<div class='post'>
Inspired by <a href="http://mikeylynch.blogspot.com">Mikey</a>, I've set up my own <a href="http://life.mumak.net">real-life blog</a>.<br /><br />I've done this one using Blogger's "upload to remote server" feature. It looks nice, has the features I need and means less WordPress &amp; PHP. I'm hoping to migrate this sucker to the same technology.</div>
