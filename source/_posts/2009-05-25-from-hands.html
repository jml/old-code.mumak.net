Just starting at UDS after a week at Canonical's Allhands event. Allhands was great, but one of the highlights for me was the Landscape team's presentation on their development process:<br /><blockquote>We optimize for fun. If something works really well in theory but it makes things less fun, then we don't do it.<br /></blockquote></div>
