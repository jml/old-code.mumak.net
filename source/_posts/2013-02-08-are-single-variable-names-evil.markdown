A colleague recently asked the question, “Are single letter variable names
evil?”. He was trolling, and I kind of knew it, but gosh, what an excuse to
rant about code clarity! My comments ended up being multiple pages long, so
taking one of [Mary Gardiner](http://mary.gardiner.id.au/)’s suggestions to
heart (although I’m sure she regrets it now), I’ve turned it into a blog post.

In a nutshell, I don’t think single variable names are evil. Lots of the time
they are a bad idea though.

The classic rule of thumb I’ve heard is that “the length of the variable name
should be proportional to the log of the size of the scope”. I can’t find who
said that originally. My
[best guess is Mike Haertel](http://www.jetcafe.org/jim/c-style.html). It
seems to be a good rule of thumb.

But the corollary is that sometimes when the code is confusing, the problem
isn’t short variable names, it’s that the scope is too large.

Perhaps there’s also something to be said for shorter names being more useful
for really generic code? I’m OK with an implementation of map taking either
`f` and `xs` or `function` and `things`. I don’t think either is better or
worse.

And maybe single letter variable names are acceptable when they are the
standard terms for the problem domain. `(x, y)` might be clearer than
`(horizontal_position, vertical_position)`.

Finally, Python’s idiomatic filtering strongly encourages short names, because
you have to repeat it three times within the scope of one expression:

``` python
[x for x in meaningfully_named_list_of_things if x.relevance > THRESHOLD]
```

vs:

``` python
[meaningful_name
 for meaningful_name in meaningfully_named_list_of_things
 if meaningful_name.relevance > THRESHOLD]
```

It’s probably subjective, but I think the second one is less clear, since it
obscures what’s going on.﻿ Bice Dibley points out that in these list
comprehensions, `x` functions much like a pronoun in English.

As is the case when writing prose, being clear is hard. Rules can help –
taking knowledge and distilling it into formal principles is one of the best
ways for us to progress as a species! – but as Orwell said:

Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
