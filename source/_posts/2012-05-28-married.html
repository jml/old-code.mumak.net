I'm back online after three weeks vacation. Purpose of said vacation was to get married and go on honeymoon. Only thing to say about that is: huge success. I'm very, very happy.<br /><br />While I've been gone, Ubuntu has had its developer summit and decreed that Ubuntu 12.10 will have only Python 3 on the CD. As such, a few people have&nbsp;done a bunch of work on the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools">testtools</a> cluster (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixtures">fixtures</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testscenarios">testscenarios</a>, etc.), making them Python 3 compatible, or fixing compatibility bugs where they existed. It's such a nice feeling to come back from vacation and taste the delicious fruits of other's labour. Well done all!<br /><br /></div>
