<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2008/12/version-control.html">As I mentioned</a> on <a href="http://life.mumak.net/">my other blog</a>, I really struggle to explain version control to non-programmers. In particular, I don't know how to communicate just how <span style="font-style: italic;">cool</span> it is.<br /><br /><a href="http://randsinrepose.com">Rands</a> has a go at it by explaining that it's all about <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/03/23/capturing_context.html">capturing context</a>. How do you explain Bazaar (or anything other version control) to the people you meet?</div>

Depends on who I'm talking to, but I have described version control as "Like track changes in Word, but for hundreds of documents at once." It's not really true, but it does get people into the right ballpark.</div>

I ask them if they have ever edited Wikipedia, and if they have, I point out version control features in Wikipedia to them, and how they help people to collaborate.<BR/><BR/>For programmers that are new to version control, I point them to http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html which is and excellent and comprehensive guide to version control. It is pre-dvcs, so it could do with an update.</div>

Yeah, that's what I end up saying as well. But, I'd like to have something better in reserve for people who are interested enough to know details.</div>

I tell them that I work on a tool that helps programmers collaborate.  That's a bit abstract and vague (lots of different kinds of tools could do that), but somewhat comprehensible.</div>
