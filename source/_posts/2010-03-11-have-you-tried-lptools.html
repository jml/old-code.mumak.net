Have you tried <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/lptools">lptools</a>?<br /><br />It's not at all officially associated with the Launchpad project, of course, but it's got a few nice things that you might want to look at, including:<div><ul><li>a milestone manipulator</li><li>a code review notifier, and</li><li>a milestone to iCal exporter</li></ul>One of these days, I'd like for there to be an official, awesome Launchpad command-line client. As it is, I'm happy with the world of people making extensions to meet their needs.<br /><br />For other extensions, check out the <a href="https://launchpad.net/lpx">lpx project</a> or our <a href="http://help.launchpad.net/Clients">list of clients</a>.<br /></div></div>
