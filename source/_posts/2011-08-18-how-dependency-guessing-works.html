Although in my <a href="http://code.mumak.net/2011/08/automagic-packaging-of-binary-apps-for.html">last post</a> I talked about our proof of concept tool, I didn't actually explain how to use it. That's mostly because it's not quite ready to be used by others. There's a good reason.<br /><br />The most interesting thing that <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/+junk/pkgme-binary">pkgme-binary</a> does is to guess the dependencies of an application given only its tarball. The way it does this is by finding all of the ELF objects (executables, shared libraries etc.), reading the symbols from them, and figuring out the packages based on those.<br /><br />Canny readers are already thinking, "Yes, that is what dpkg-shlibdeps does" â€“ which is true. As some background, Debian packages that export symbols for linking also provide explicit metadata about those symbols and what versions they appear in, in order to allow Debian packagers to figure out dependencies easily using dpkg-shlibdeps. Fascinating reading can be found in the <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html">Debian policy manual</a>, a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/ImprovedDpkgShlibdeps">spec on improving dpkg-shlibdeps</a> and <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/UsingSymbolsFiles">the guide on using the new symbol files</a>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, dpkg-shlibdeps can only query packages that are installed on your system. If you have a binary with symbols that are not provided by any library on your system, you cannot use it to calculate dependencies. Debian (or the Debian flavour of your choosing) might have a perfectly good package to satisfy that dependency, but you won't be able to find it.<br /><br />So, to do dependency guessing properly, you need to have a database mapping symbols back to packages. Debian already has something like this in its <a href="http://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/mole/seedsymbols/">mole database</a>. Ubuntu doesn't have anything like this that I know about.<br /><br />Assembling and maintaining such a database is pretty much a simple matter of programming, but it's still work that I wanted to avoid for the proof-of-concept. Instead, I used the mole database in Debian for the calculations. That means we'll get wrong answers for Ubuntu, but it demonstrates that the concept works.<br /><br />Since I have a copy of that mole database locally, and since it's about 1.5GB, I'm not distributing it with the branch. Which means that the <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/+junk/pkgme-binary">automagic binary packaging branch</a> won't actually work for you.<br /><br /></div>
