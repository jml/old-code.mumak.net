<div class='post'>
I wrote a whole pile of documentation for <a href="https://launchpad.net/testtools">testtools</a>&nbsp;over the weekend. You can read it <a href="http://mumak.net/testtools/docs/">here</a>.<br /><br />I would very much appreciate it if you could read over the docs there and tell me if anything is unclear, wrong or otherwise unhelpful. &nbsp;Telling me what's good would also be appreciated.<br /><br />Please leave whatever feedback you have either as comments on this post or on the <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jml/testtools/more-doc-improvements/+merge/42045">merge proposal</a>.</div>
