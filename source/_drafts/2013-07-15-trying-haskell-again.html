I've been wanting to muck-around with Haskell again for ages and ages now. My recent trip to the UK gave me a chance to do that. Here are some quick reflections:<br /><br /><ul><li>Typeclasses are great</li><li>I forgot to install docs on my laptop before I hit the road, but I got a fairly long way by looking at old code that I had written</li><li>I spent a lot of time making the type system happy for some fairly basic numeric operations</li><li>I really love Haskell's pattern matching</li><li>I really, really love the magic combination of partial application and function composition. It's such a nice feeling to make a useful programming by just gluing parts together.</li><ul><li>There's a significant readability boost with point-free style (f . g . h) vs nested call style (f(g(h(x))))</li></ul><li>When I'm writing Haskell, I miss literal map (dict) syntax</li><li>Guy Steele did a talk on map/reduce as a primitive which I'm constantly reminded of and need to re-watch and understand</li><li>The main thing that attracts me to Haskell &amp; Clojure is immutable data structures</li><li>Haskell is more attractive than Clojure for command-line scripts, because JRE start-up time is prohibitively expensive</li><li>Haskell does indeed have a learning curve</li><ul><li>I'm optimistic that this will go away as more concepts filter down to more mainstream languages</li></ul><li>Understanding mathematical concepts (e.g. knowing what 'associative operator' means) might sound ivory tower, but helps so much when making things that can be combined, re-used, and understood.</li><ul><li>If PHP developers knew that equality is an equivalence relation and that equivalence relations are transitive then perhaps === wouldn't be necessary.</li><li>XXX: Probably make this a separate post</li></ul><li>ghci is much better than hugs</li><li>I miss the quick hacking loop of Python. The "Real World Haskell" authors suggest that a good way to do this is use the ghci repl to develop things and then move into your file. I need to work on this.</li><li>My exercise was to do thinkstats exercises in Haskell. This is quite nice.</li><li>Data.Map is a binary tree. Why not a HAMT?</li></ul><div>XXX: Maybe rewrite for audience = Python developers.</div><div>XXX: Maybe include / link to code that I wrote</div><div><br /></div></div>
